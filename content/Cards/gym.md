"Cutting" and "bulking" are terms often used in the context of bodybuilding and fitness to refer to specific phases of training and nutrition.

Cutting: The "cutting" phase is a period of time when an individual is trying to reduce their body fat percentage and lean out, while maintaining or even increasing muscle mass. This is typically achieved through a combination of calorie restriction, strength training, and cardiovascular exercise. The goal of the cutting phase is to achieve a more toned and defined appearance.

Bulking: The "bulking" phase is a period of time when an individual is trying to build muscle mass by increasing their caloric intake and lifting heavier weights. The goal of the bulking phase is to create a calorie surplus, which allows the body to build new muscle tissue. However, it is also common for people to gain some fat during the bulking phase, as it is difficult to build muscle without also increasing body fat to some extent.
