However, one must be careful to not make this single chance at life a pressure to get it all right and [[perfectionism|perfect]], in fact, the opposite is encouraged. You will mostly do a lot of the wrong things, think a lot of the wrong thoughts, and feel a lot of the wrong feelings. But since this is only your first and last chance at life, it is okay. You are driving blind through the most impossibly complex, strange maze. What use is getting more upset or guilty about feeling upset or guilty in an existence where thats bound to happen.
