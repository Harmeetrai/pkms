- you only get 1 shot today
- you have 24 hours to take your best shot
- then this time is gone and lost forever
- fully inhabit all of today
- Will you call out "I've got this" and do your very best to be your very best? 
- What will you manage to make of today before it slips from your fingers and becomes the past?
- When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be **nothing**?
