Quantization noise: the difference between the actual value of the analog signal, for the particular sampling time, and the nearest quantization interval value. 
- At most, this error can be as much as half of the interval.

The quality of the quantization is characterized by the Signal to Quantization Noise Ratio ([[SQNR]])
- a special case of [[SNR]]
