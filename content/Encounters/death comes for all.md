# Death
In the book by Ernest Becker, *The Denial of Death*, the author argued that death and the denial of death is primary underpinning motivation force responsible for the majority of human behavior. We need to be aware that death comes for us all and there's no way to stop it. 

You will die but you are alive now. We create and engage in symbolic constructs, cultural activities, and beliefs in an attempt to deny our cosmic [[finding purpose|insignificance and convince ourselves that we matter]]. This meaning could come from external factors such as fame, fortune, successful career. We have this urge to become hero's so the world could see us and tell us that we are good enough.

- Becker offered a sort of honesty and humility about one's condition: [[live with intense humility]]
- [[what matters to you right now]]
- [[at some point, it will be your last time]]
- [[it's okay to not get it right]]
