Here are some strategies that can help you build confidence:

1. Set realistic goals for yourself and strive to achieve them. This can help you feel a sense of accomplishment and boost your confidence.
2. Practice self-affirmation and positive self-talk. Remind yourself of your strengths and accomplishments, and try to focus on the positive aspects of yourself and your life.
3. Seek out new experiences and challenges. Taking on new tasks and learning new skills can help you build confidence and feel more capable.
4. Dress and groom yourself in a way that makes you feel good about yourself. Presenting yourself in a way that reflects your values and personality can boost your self-esteem.
5. Seek out supportive relationships. Surrounding yourself with people who are positive and supportive can help you feel more confident and secure.
6. Take care of your physical health. Exercise, eat a healthy diet, and get enough sleep can all contribute to feeling more confident and capable.
7. Practice relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation. These can help you manage stress and anxiety, which can in turn boost your confidence.

Remember that building confidence is a process and it may take time. Be patient with yourself and try to focus on the progress you are making, rather than any setbacks or challenges.
