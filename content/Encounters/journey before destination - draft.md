# Fear of change
- we are afraid of change, we want to live comfortable lives and stay that way
- it is engrained in human nature to strive for comfort as it is primal
- comfort kills hopes and dreams
- we often are ready to take that first step, however, the pull of social media and our negative identity stops us
- we compare ourselves to others, and our internal voice tells us to give up
- we think that lifes a race, that we are always behind
- we often think of all the negative outcomes that might happen

# Negative Identity
- when we where kids, we formed an identity of who we are
- these are societal rules, we can't draw on walls, hit people, steal
- these rules are good as they teach us how to become civilized and good people
- However, this is a double edged sword. Our identity tells us what is good or bad, what we can do and cannot do. When we grow up, this idenity stays with us.
- the identiy tells us that we enough, and its okay to stop and give up. Its okay to stay the way u are, what will other people think
- soon this identity traps us inside a prison in our own minds, we are just following the image we project to ourselves

# Change
- it takes courage to change our identity, but it can be done.
- it takes courage to take the first step
- true transformation lies in the inner pursuit of self mastery
- it requires vulnerability and humiliation as we are learning to become who we are
