Perfectionism isn’t actually wanting everything to be right. It’s not a good thing. In fact, it is a hindering thing, because it sets up unrealistic expectations about what we are capable of or what the outcomes of our lives could be.
- Don’t worry about doing it well; just do it.
- Don’t worry about writing a bestseller, just write. 
- Don’t worry about making a Grammy-winning hit, just make music. 
- Don’t worry about failing, just keep showing up and trying. 

The fact that you are imperfect is not a sign that you have failed; it is a sign that you are human, and more importantly, it is a sign that you still have more potential within you.

At first, all that matters is that you *do* what you really want to do. From there, you can [[learning from mistakes|learn from your mistakes]] and over time get to the place where you really want to be.
- Instead of perfection, focus on [[personal progress]]. Instead of having something done perfectly, focus on just getting it done. From there, you can edit, build, grow, and develop it to exactly what your vision is. But if you don’t get started, you’ll never arrive.

Often, we are making decisions based on how we imagine people view our lives, not how they actually are. Instead of thinking that we need to prove to everyone around us how perfect and flawless we are, we can imagine ourselves more realistically: as people who, despite our weaknesses, are trying our best.

People will respect you far more if you can acknowledge that you are an imperfect person—like everyone else—learning, adapting, and trying your best. See the [[Cards/Self-Improvement/fear of yourself]] to overcome yourself

The truth is that you do not change your life when you fix every piece and call that healing. You change your life when you start showing up exactly as you are. You change your life when you become comfortable with being happy here, even if you want to go forward. You change your life when you can love yourself even though you don’t look exactly the way you want to. You change your life when you are principled about money and love and relationships, when you treat strangers as well as you do your CEO, and when you manage $1,000 the same way you would $10,000.
