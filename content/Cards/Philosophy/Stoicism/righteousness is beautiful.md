- our standards for what's attractive are incredibly un-stoic in what we prize and extol things people have almost no control over
	- being tall, facial features, genetics
- if it really beautiful to win the genetic lottery? Or should beauty be contingent on the choices,  actions, and attributes we develop?
- An even keel, a sense of justice, a commitment to duty, these are ==beautiful traits== and they go much deeper than appearances
- starting today, act with justice, keep an even keel, and be in [[control of yourself]]
	- this will involve [[dedication]] and [[sacrifice]]
- if this is not beautiful, then what is?
