# Linked List
---
A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the **data** and the **address** of the next node. For example,

![linked list data structure](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/linked-list-concept.png "Linked list Data Structure")

You have to start somewhere, so we give the address of the first node a special name called `HEAD`. Also, the last node in the linked list can be identified because its next portion points to `NULL`.

Linked lists can be of multiple types: 
- [[singly|singly linked list]]
- [[doubly linked list]]
- [[circular linked list]]
