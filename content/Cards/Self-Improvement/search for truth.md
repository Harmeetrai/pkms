All of humanity is searching for truth, justice, and beauty. We keep searching and seraching, when everything is already within us. There is not truth to find. Whenever we turn our heads, all we see is the truth, but with the agreements and belifs we have stored in our minds, we have no eyes for this truth. 

We are blinded of our own false beliefs in our minds. We have the needs to always be right and make others feel wrong. We want to feel good about ourselves, if that means wronging other people. We live in this fog which is called *minote*. Your reality/dream is where thousand people talk at the same time, nobody understands each other. We cannot see who we truly are, we cannot see that we are not free. We live in this state of always trying to get the next big thing.
