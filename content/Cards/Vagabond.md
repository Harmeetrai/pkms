## Thoughts
This series has helped me realize what it means to be strong.
- How to be disciplined, have a postive mindset, and most importantly, be kind
- [[kindness]]: "All truly strong people are kind"
- I do think this series is better than [[Berserk]] due to its art style and overall theme (however, I think both are top tier and berserk is a better storyline)
