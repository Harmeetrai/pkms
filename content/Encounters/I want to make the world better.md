# I want to make the world better

Even though, as of end of 2023, im unsure what my mission in life is, what my [[finding purpose|purpose]] is, I want to leave a positive impact on the world. I want my existence to be bigger than who I am. I don't want wealth, I want peace that I did everything I could do to make it better. I want to try my best. Even if it takes decades, I will keep trying everyday. However, there is the [[fear of living]] I have, which basically means that im not [[perfectionism|good enough]]. 

## Some ways/ideas
- filmmaking
	- I could create inspirational films that educate people, I want it to be cinematic with good editing. I want to help others understand in a creative way.
- volunteering
	- I could help others, or create a non-profit organization to provide help in areas that are in desperate need.
- coding
	- I could write code/ products that makes people more productive?
- always trying to become a [[the better version of myself|better person]]
