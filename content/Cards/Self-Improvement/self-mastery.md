# Self-Mastery

If you want to master your life, you have to learn to organize your feelings. By becoming aware of them, you can trace them back to the thought process that prompted them, and from there you can decide whether or not the idea is an actual threat or concern, or a fabrication of your reptilian mind just trying to keep you alive

Aside from your own basic security, your needs are to be nourished, to sleep well, to live in a clean environment, to dress appropriately, and to allow yourself to feel what you feel without judgment or suppression. Finding ways to meet these needs on your own is the foundation of overcoming [[self-sabotage]].

[[emotional intelligence]] is the ability to understand, interpret, and respond to your emotions in an enlightened and healthy way. People with high emotional intelligence are often able to better get along with different types of people, feel more contentment and satisfaction in their everyday lives, and consistently take time to process and express their authentic feelings.

## Inner Peace
[[inner peace ]]is the state of being connected to the deep internal knowing that everything is okay and always will be. The concept of finding one’s “inner peace” has been part of spiritual and metaphysical practices for centuries and has just recently become more mainstream with the development of popular psychology.

## Self-Love
It does not matter what your life looks like on the outside; it is how you feel about it on the inside. It is not okay to be constantly stressed, panicked, and unhappy. Something is wrong, and the longer you try to “[[self-love|love yourself]] ” out of realizing this, the longer you are going to suffer

## Discipline
[[discipline|Self-discipline]] is crutial to achieving optimal health (physical and mental) and living a happy life. I believe that humans aren't meant to be [[seek discomfort|comfortable]]. We need to have a noble pursuit. Life is a journey, a constant battle to reach higher with many ups and downs. Learn to be [[gratitude|grateful]] as you never know when it will be your last.

Ultimately, self-mastery is a life long journey. [[finding purpose|Purpose]] is key in establishing what you want in life. All humans have the ability to do good and evil, all humans are born equally with slight distinctions. Blaming things outside your control won't solve your problems. Look inward and find your trueself.
