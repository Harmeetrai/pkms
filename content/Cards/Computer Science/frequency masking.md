# Frequency Masking

If within a critical band a stronger sound and weaker sound compete, you can’t hear the weaker sound. Don’t encode it.

Our brains perceive the sounds through 25 distinct [[critical band]]. The bandwidth grows with frequency (above 500Hz). A [[bark unit]] is the width of one critical band for any masking frequency. 
- At 100Hz, the bandwidth is about 160Hz;
- At 10kHz it is about 2.5kHz in width.
