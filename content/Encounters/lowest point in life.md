# The Lowest Point in Life

When your at your lowest point in life, just start walking. Do something. Make a bit of progress. Be [[discipline|disciplined]] even though you don't know where your going. Its okay to be lost in life. But don't just wait around for change to come to you, you must seek it yourself. You must take action, you must find your own mountain to climb. There are always opportunities in life, one must seek it.
