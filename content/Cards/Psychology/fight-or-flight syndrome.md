 The fight-or-flight response refers to your bodyâ€™s response to a perceived or real stressful situation, such as needing to escape danger. The perception of threat activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers an acute stress response that prepares the body to fight or flee. These responses are evolutionary adaptations to increase chances of survival in threatening situations.
