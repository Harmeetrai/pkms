# Be impeccable with your word

Your word is the power that you have to create. Through the word you express your creative power. The word is not just a sound or a written symbol. The word is a force, the power you have to express and communicate, to think, and thereby to create the events in your life.

Impeccability means without [[sin]]. Everything you feel or believe or say that goes against yourself is a sin. When you are impeccable, you take responsibility for your actions, but you do not judge or blame yourself.

If I love myself I will express that love in my interactions with you, and then I am being impeccable with the word because that action will produce a like reaction. If I hate you, you will hate me. If im grateful for you, you have [[gratitude]] toward me. 

Being impeccable with your word is the correct use of energy. You use that energy toward finding truth and love for yourself. We often use words to destroy and put down others to make ourselves feel better. Use the word to share love, kindness. Don't let negative words in. Tell yourself postive things, then you will be a postive person. Don't let poison in.
