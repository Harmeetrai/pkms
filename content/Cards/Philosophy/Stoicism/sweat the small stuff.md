- small things/actions add up
- someone is a [[good person]] not because they say they are but because they take [[good action]]
- one does not magically get one's act together, it is a matter of many individual choices
- practicing [[atomic habits]]: getting up at the same time, making bed, resisting shortcuts and pleasures, investing in yourself, and doing your work
- these small steps lead to exponential growth
- make the right choices and habits and you will grow
