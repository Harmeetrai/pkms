## Highlights
- A man’s worth can be found in his depth of being. A shallow man, easily perturbed and swayed, is worth less to his woman and his world than a man whose presence is deeply sourced. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=115))
- Identified with money or accomplishments, a man feels weak when he compares himself to others who have more. But when he knows himself to be self-radiant awareness, conscious and lit up, awakening as man, he blooms in perfect harmony with the immense energy of reality. The infinite force of now is his power and his presence. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=126))
- One of the more important lessons is this: as evolving human beings, we can learn that mastery is an important phase to accomplish and pass through in this school of life where we are learning to love more artfully. ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=141))
- Stop waiting. Feel everything. Love achingly. Give impeccably. Let go. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=158))

- Sexual attraction is based on sexual polarity, which is the force of passion that arcs between masculine and feminine poles. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=204))
- If men and women are clinging to a politically correct sameness even in moments of intimacy, then sexual attraction disappears. ([Location 214](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=214))
- unless you discover this deep purpose and live it fully, your life will feel empty at its core, even if your intimate relationship and family life are full of love. ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=235))
- The “mission” or the search for freedom is the priority of the masculine, whereas the search for love is the priority of the feminine. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=238))
- when you deny your true core you deny the possibility of true and real love. Love is openness, through and through. And true spirituality is the practice of love, the practice of openness. A person who denies their own essence and hides their true desires is divided and unable to relax into the full openness of love. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=283))

- Don’t believe in the myth of “one day when everything will be different.” Do what you love to do, what you are waiting to do, what you’ve been born to do, now. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=333))
- Men who have lived significant lives are men who never waited: not for money, security, ease, or women. Feel what you want to give most as a gift, to your woman and to the world, and do what you can to give it today. Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=353))
- Your edge is where you stop short, or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to your fears. ([Location 398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=398))
- A free man is free to acknowledge his fears, without hiding them, or hiding from them. Live with your lips pressed against your fears, kissing your fears, neither pulling back nor aggressively violating them. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=417))
## New highlights added December 25, 2023 at 7:04 PM
- Eternity must be a man’s home, moment by moment. Without it, he is lost, always striving, grasping at puffs of smoke. A man must do anything necessary to glimpse, and then stabilize, this ever-fresh realization, and organize his life around it. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=423))
- Make your life an ongoing process of being who you are, at your deepest, most easeful levels of being. Everything other than this process is secondary. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=425))
- Know eternity. Do whatever it takes. And from this depth of being, live the details of your life. But if you postpone the process of submerging yourself in the source for the sake of taking care of business first, your life will be spent in hours and days of business, and then it will be gone. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=439))
- Be open to changing your feeling based on whatever your woman might reveal to you—through her words or her body language—and then make your own decision, based on your deepest intuitive wisdom and knowledge. You may make the right decision or the wrong one, but whatever happens, it is your best shot, and you will strengthen your capacity for future action. ([Location 468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=468))
- Your fear is the sharpest definition of your self. You should know it. You should feel it virtually constantly. Fear needs to become your friend, so that you are no longer uncomfortable with it. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=500))
- Own your fear, and lean just beyond it. In every aspect of your life. Starting now. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=511))
- The superior man is not seeking for fulfillment through work and woman, because he is already full. For him, work and intimacy are opportunities to give his gifts, and be vanished in the bliss of the giving. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=608))
- man must be prepared to give 100 percent to his purpose, fulfill his karma or dissolve it, and then let go of that specific form of living. He must be capable of not knowing what to do with his life, entering a period of unknowingness and waiting for a vision or a new form of purpose to emerge. These cycles of strong specific action followed by periods of not knowing what the hell is going on are natural for a man who is shedding layers of karma in his relaxation into truth. ([Location 614](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=614))
- success is never as fulfilling as you think it is going to be. But there is a reason for this. Successfully completing a lesser purpose doesn’t feel very good for very long, because it is simply preparation for advancing toward a greater embodiment of your deeper purpose. Each purpose, each mission, is meant to be fully lived to the point where it becomes empty, boring, and useless. Then it should be discarded. This is a sign of growth, but you may mistake it for a sign of failure. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=631))
- Whatever the specifics of a man’s purpose, he must always refresh the transcendental element of his life through regular meditation and retreat. A man should never get lost in the details of his life and forget that, ultimately and in truth, life amounts to nothing other than what is the deepest truth of this present moment. Tasks don’t get a man anywhere more conscious or free than he is capable of being in this present moment. ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=737))
- You are not a drone. You are the unbounded mystery of love. Be so, without forgetting your tasks. ([Location 769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=769))
- You don’t need her validation in order for you to be loving. You simply are loving. The truth of you is love. Your fullness is independent of mommy. You are not only a man, you are a superior man: a man who does his best to live as love in the world and in his intimacy, a man whose heart remains open and whose truth remains strong even when his woman criticizes him, a man who can find the humor in forgetting to pick up the milk on a day he made a million dollars. ([Location 819](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=819))
- A superior man sees his woman’s moods not as a curse, but as a challenge and an amusement. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=927))

- you must know what is important for you, what is the purpose of your intimacy, and align all other activities around this central priority, if you want your intimacy to maintain and increase its potency for both of you. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1292))
- The priority of the masculine core is mission, purpose, or direction in life. The priority of the feminine core is the flow of love in intimacy. ([Location 1433](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1433))
- Your word is a demonstration of your purpose, of your masculine core. When you don’t follow through with what you say you are going to do, she feels that your masculine core is weak. She feels let down. She can’t trust your masculine direction. And so she feels a great loss. ([Location 1523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1523))
- Although your woman seems to want to be the most important thing in your life, she actually can trust and love you more if she is not. ([Location 1568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1568))
- A man’s highest purpose is his priority, not his intimacy. Your woman knows this. Deep inside, she really wants it to be this way. ([Location 1570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1570))
- If a woman has become the point of your life, you are lost. You have a gift to give, a purpose to fulfill, a deep heart-impulse that moves you. ([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1575))
## New highlights added December 28, 2023 at 12:21 AM
- All masculine goals—at work, on the meditation cushion, or on the football field—are directed toward more freedom. ([Location 1683](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1683))
- To live free in spirit, you must be willing to face your fears and let go of anything that limits your love. The attachment to comfort and security is what limits most men in their capacity to make a spiritual touchdown. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1693))
- In the end, the feminine search for love and the masculine search for freedom reach the same destination: the unbounded and infinite ground of being who you are, which is both absolute love and freedom. ([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1715))
- You must learn to let go, absolutely, in love with your woman. Unless you choose to live your life as a celibate, there is no way around this. You must be as fearless with your sexual desire as you are with your spiritual desire. ([Location 1752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1752))
- To truly ravish your woman in love, you must yield yourself in the worship and trust of her heart, which, in truth, is your heart. Such fearlessness will prepare you for and perhaps even initiate you into the worship and trust of consciousness itself, such that you will find greater and greater capacity to yield into and as the boundless One who you truly are. ([Location 1776](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1776))
- The knowledge of death makes you humble and courageous. The knowledge of death strips the armor from your heart and allows the knowledge of love. This knowledge of death and love is your doorway through your own fears, through your own clinging to security, and into the unknowable mystery that lies beyond your little cell of self-protected importance. ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1808))
- Your body, tone of voice, and the look in your eyes mean a lot more to her than anything you could say. Don’t tell her what to do, but do it with her, with your body. If she is tense and closed down, lift her arms up above her head and kiss her heart. Don’t just tell her to open up. Actually open her up, physically, with the openness of your body. ([Location 1843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=1843))
## New highlights added December 28, 2023 at 8:32 PM
- A superior man always assumes complete responsibility, knowing that, ultimately, he has no control at all and everything is out of his hands. He acts with impeccable courage and persistence, expecting nothing but the inherent feeling of completeness he enjoys in the fullest giving of his gift. ([Location 2003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2003))
- When your woman is looking withdrawn, dark, or downright ugly, assume she is a goddess and needs your divine invasion of her heart and body. ([Location 2006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2006))
- It only takes a moment of meeting a real challenge to bring a man back to full purpose, an emergency or a threat that demands his best. And it only takes a moment of praise and deep appreciation to re-evoke a woman’s radiance. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2021))
- You are least unhappy when you are relieved of the need to get anything at all from appearance. Just driving in your car, wanting nothing, watching the trees go by, can be an epiphany of perfection. ([Location 2055](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2055))
- Your ultimate desire is for the union of consciousness with its own luminosity, wherein all appearance is recognized as your deep, blissful nature, and there is only One. Your desire for union with a woman is a stepped-down version of this ultimate spiritual need. ([Location 2065](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2065))
- It feels great for a few moments, but the price you pay for the genital sneeze of ejaculation is a much higher level of mediocrity in your daily life. ([Location 2100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2100))
- In a subtle way, excess ejaculations will diminish your courage to take risks, professionally and spiritually. You will settle for doing enough to get by, to be comfortable, but you will find that you would rather watch TV than write your novel, meditate, or make that important phone call. ([Location 2102](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2102))
- When you don’t ejaculate, but demonstrate that the fullness of loving is more important to you than the quick thrill of genital release, then she can truly trust you. But she will continue to test your capacity for loving, even once you’ve demonstrated your capacity to bypass ejaculation for the sake of a much more profound bliss. ([Location 2155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2155))
- Your woman will be sexually, emotionally, and spiritually unfulfilled to the extent that you are addicted to ejaculation. And, in many ways, the world will be just as unfulfilled by your gifts. Your addiction to cycles of release will stop you short of full and conscious dissolution in your deepest source, and so your true gifts will not emerge. ([Location 2161](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2161))
## New highlights added December 28, 2023 at 10:32 PM
- Your breath is a primary expression of your personal energy. Therefore, your breath is one of the primary ways to give your gift to the world. ([Location 2204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2204))
## New highlights added December 30, 2023 at 6:46 AM
- When you are absorbed in your mission, you often forget entirely about your intimacy. For your woman, the intimacy is at the core of her life and colors everything else she does. This is the primary asymmetry in intimacy. ([Location 2357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2357))
- When your life is truly aligned with your highest purpose, you will become more present, more loving, and more humorous. Your woman will then be the first recipient of your magnified presence, love, and humor. If your intimacy is not constantly growing in this way, your life is not aligned with your highest purpose. ([Location 2396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2396))
- Your masculine gift is to know where you are, where you want to be, and what you need to do to get there. If you don’t know one of these, then you need to discover it by any means necessary. This vision is, essentially, the basic gift you have to offer your woman, as well as the world. If you have no higher vision than the day-to-day grind of housework, job, childcare, TV, and vacations, you are failing your birthright. Your woman will feel cheated and ungifted by you, as will the world. And they will both give you less of their gifts in return. ([Location 2425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2425))
- Your woman may not want to receive your gift. Your woman may resist your gift. And so may the world. But you have no choice. Live at your edge. Love as fully as possible. ([Location 2454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2454))
## New highlights added December 30, 2023 at 10:58 PM
- rather than wanting his woman to follow his personal direction, a superior man wants her to move in the direction that most serves her growth in love and happiness. He will settle for nothing less. ([Location 2466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2466))
- You are entirely responsible for cutting through your own laziness, addictions, and unclarity. There is nothing to wait for and nobody to blame. ([Location 2489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2489))
- The cure for lack of purpose is to be challenged to live at your edge, since you have lost the capacity to live there by yourself. ([Location 2520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2520))
- Austerity means to eliminate the comforts and cushions in your life that you have learned to snuggle into and lose wakefulness. Take away anything that dulls your edge. No newspapers or magazines. No TV. No candy, cookies, or sweets. No sex. No cuddling. No reading of anything at all while you eat or sit on the toilet. Reduce working time to a necessary minimum. No movies. No conversation that isn’t about truth, love, or the divine. ([Location 2522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2522))
- By eliminating the safety net of comforts in your life, you have the opportunity to free fall in this moment between birth and death, right through the hole of your fear, into the unthreatenable openness which is the source of your gifts. The superior man lives as this spontaneous sacrifice of love. ([Location 2538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2538))
- there must be a consequence for freezing in the face of fear. There are obvious consequences for freezing in the face of fear when mountain climbing or playing competitive sports. You must instill consequences throughout the rest of your life, unless you want to cling to the safety net of superficial pleasures. ([Location 2548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2548))
- Spend time every day in solitude, with no distractions. Just sit, for ten minutes. No fidgeting, no channel surfing, no magazine thumbing. Just be, exactly as you are, not trying to change anything. Stay with your suffering, until you fall through it and intuit the groundless source of your life. ([Location 2556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01NA993PI&location=2556))
