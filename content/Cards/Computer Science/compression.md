The emergence of multimedia technologies has made digital libraries a reality. Nowadays, libraries, museums, film studios, and governments are converting more and more data and archives into digital form.

The main problem is that this “great idea” requires too many bits. And in fact there exist many coding techniques that will effectively reduce the total number of bits needed to represent the above information. The process involved is generally referred to as **compression**

>Compression is the process of coding that will effectively reduce the total number of bits needed to represent certain information.

If the compression and decompression processes induce no information loss, the compression scheme is [[lossless compression]]; otherwise, it is [[lossy compression]].
