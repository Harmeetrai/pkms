## Highlights
- In truth, no matter what we think we know, we are probably wrong, and no matter what anyone else thinks they know, they are probably wrong. No one knows what’s going on in any fundamental sense. Nothing about this life is simple or clear, and from the perspective of the stars, nothing down here on earth—including us—matters all that much to anything beyond itself. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=69))
- “Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough,” said renowned theoretical physicist Richard Feynman. ([Location 72](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=72))
- At the base of almost everything, the resulting truth is this: we don’t know. When we disregard this unknowingness, we can easily become disinterested, uninspired, and worn out of this life. We can put great stress on things that perhaps don’t matter all that much and neglect experiences and things that do. We can feel the pressure and anxiety of chasing perfection and certainty, which do not exist. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=79))
- We should look to the universe often, not solely for answers but for perspective; for a helpful adjustment and an aerial consideration of our daily life. With this practice, the little things in life become more striking, the mistakes and the annoyances become less significant, the calm comes more easily, ([Location 83](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=83))
- The philosophy of Stoicism suggests that the universe is indifferent to what we want from it. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=112))
- Buddhism says that life is suffering. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=112))
- Existentialism and Absurdism say that we are stricken by our need for meaning in a life that is inherently meaningless. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=113))
- Christianity proclaims that the condition of humankind is inflicted with temptation and imperfection. ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=114))
- A healthy dose of pessimism is necessary in our ability to adequately deal with this life. It helps us mitigate our expectations and serves as padding that protects us from life’s constant attempts to beat our spirit out of us. ([Location 118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=118))
- We are all struggling and improvising our way through this strange existence, constantly confused and unsure. No one is perfect or normal in any traditional sense. No one knows who or why they are. We all make mistakes, big and small. Happiness is hard and unclear. There appears to be no achievement, material item, or endgame that can solve all the problems we face as individuals or as a species. ([Location 123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=123))
- To give up on life entirely would be like refusing to play a game because we lose sometimes, as if the game would even be worth playing if we knew we were going to win every time we played. There is courage in facing the realities of pessimism and there is strength to be formed in its name. We must be pessimistic about life’s conditions in order to face their realities, but we must also be optimistic about our ability to face their realities and form strength, meaning, and experience through them. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=135))
- In the dirt of life, it is up to us to plant the seeds, watch the flowers grow, and enjoy their beauty, even in spite of the fact that we know that they will die. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=143))
- “[t]he only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing.” ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=171))
- Perhaps there are no ultimate answers in philosophy, perhaps there never will be, but there are no ultimate answers in music, in art, in a beautiful landscape, or in a conversation with a friend, and yet, I know of no one who does not find value, insight, love, and solace in all of these things. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=238))
- Perhaps what we should and only can do is to try to enjoy the process of playing with the blocks of philosophy like children playing with toy blocks for no reason other than the curiosity and fun of it; not because in the end the blocks will provide something that stays up forever, but because we inevitably will take the blocks down, put them away for a little while, and then play with them again on another day, in a different way.

- Central to [[Taoism]] is the idea that everything is in a continual state of flux, ceaselessly changing and adapting. Thus, no single idea or thing is to be attached to. Nothing is to be forced in or out of place. All is to be permitted to run its natural course, subject to the one, constant, unchanging truth: everything changes. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=270))
- The Tao is generally translated as the way, which in the context of Taoism, refers to the natural way or order of the universe. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=274))

- Essential to [[taoism]] is living according to the Tao. Put more simply, it is living in accordance with nature. Lao Tzu suggests that one can accomplish this by accepting the fluctuation of everything and giving up rigid judgments, attachments, expectations, and our efforts to control our lives. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=285))
- For Lao Tzu, life broadly is to be lived in this zone. Like how the breath breathes, the heart beats, the birds fly, the fish migrate, the wind blows, the earth spins—all perfectly on their own—the Taoists believe that life operates most functionally when simplified to a more intuitive, natural intelligence.

- the general story of the Buddha arguably always remains the same at its core: it is a story of us all. It is the story of growing up, becoming curious and tempted, seeking to move out and beyond the borders of the sheltered reality maintained by our parents, society, and our underdeveloped psyche, beginning to discover life’s contaminated horrors for the first time, and the extreme lengths we often go to in order to try to understand, overcome, and escape them. ([Location 386](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=386))
- we suffer not as a result of not having enough things like money, status, success, or ideal external circumstances, but because the desire for such things is attached to the impossible delusion of a permanent self capable of being satisfied by desire. ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=416))
- Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself. Self-conquest is far better than the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=422))
- kōan is a riddle or dialectic meditation device used in Zen Buddhist practice that is intentionally designed to, at least on the surface, be unclear and obscure. Its point is not to provide a conclusion or answer to the question presented, but rather, to disregard the relevance of the answer—to detach itself from the functions of conclusion and singular resolution. ([Location 453](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=453))
- Zen and the lesson of the kōans suggest that we should flow with life, ask questions, contemplate them, but not become tricked by any singular idea or answer that might tempt us into a final resolution. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=485))
- Like the desire for perfect, unending happiness, the desire for complete and absolute freedom is impossible. But like happiness, it is, in its true, ultimate form, a state that comes and goes, unattainable in the ideal but attainable in the moment—in the moments when we surrender to the complete unified image of being, when we cease trying to square circles and placate everything that contests us, when we stop trying to escape what cannot be escaped. ([Location 545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=545))
- Stoicism claims that there are two domains of life: the external—the things outside of our mind, which we cannot control—and the internal—our mental reactions and interpretations of the external, which we can control. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=574))
- It is now that we must find time and it is now that we must find happiness if it is either that we are seeking, because if we do not focus the lens through which we view life right now, everything we see from this moment forward will remain out of focus. ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=601))
- we must strive for an acceptance and indifference to everything that happens, and instead, focus our attention on controlling our reactions to the things that happen. With this, we can begin to free ourselves from the chaos of the world and find some form of happiness and presence within ourselves. ([Location 609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=609))
- we must define our happiness not by what we own or achieve, not by how others see us, not by some bigger picture of life, but by how we think and see our self and live our own life through what we deem virtuous and relevant. Stoicism tells us we can at last, if we wish, calmly accept our indifferent reality and counter it with our own indifferent attitude in return. ([Location 624](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=624))
## New highlights added January 2, 2024 at 7:05 AM
- A key principle of [[Stoicism]] is understanding that if the only thing we can completely control in life is our internal domain, and we cannot truly control anything external, then one should try to maintain an awareness that the things we are concerned about could and very likely might happen, that life will contain moments of tragedy and sharp turns, and that we should be prepared for these moments both mentally and practically in any way we can. But equally important is recognizing that many of these sorts of catastrophic moments can’t be predicted nor controlled, and thus, after a point, worrying is pointless. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=636))
- Seneca wrote, “We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.” Epictetus similarly wrote, “Man is not worried by real problems so much as by his imagined anxieties about real problems.” ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=650))
- Of course, all we can do is try our best, and try our best to not worry about whether or not our best resolves the impossible. Because, in truth, there is likely no heroic, ultimate defeat of worry, but only small, mini victories, moment to moment, along the way. ([Location 677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=677))

- Wasted time or well-spent time is all the same when viewed from a sufficient distance, and it is only the individual who can examine, consider, and determine the best way to balance and claim their time in each moment. And, of course, all anyone can ever do is try their best. ([Location 749](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=749))
- I have found that this process of admitting and validating rather than denying is fundamental to the process of philosophy, meaning, and truth. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=773))
- We are perhaps the only stop on this evolutionary train that is outside the tunnel of darkness, able to take the material of everything and make it into something beautiful or helpful or interesting, to understand and create the meaning of meaning itself. And to do so just because we can, because the universe, for some reason, gave us a blank page to write on. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=829))
## New highlights added January 5, 2024 at 5:14 PM
- Nietzsche proposed that the world, including the human world, operates from a principle that he called the will to power: an insatiable desire in each living being to manifest power. “The world is the will to power—and nothing besides,” he wrote. And according to Nietzsche, this will to power is manifested in the desire for personal growth and satisfied in the pursuit of said growth. It is important to note here that his notion of power does not necessarily refer to physical strength nor power and dominance over others, but rather, power over oneself. ([Location 992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=992))
- Nietzsche argued that suffering is a good thing that should be leaned into, embraced, and used as fuel toward the amassing of strength and psychological power. Life is in fact inevitable suffering, and so, it is not a matter of if, but for what? ([Location 1005](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1005))
- Nietzsche suggested that we must symbolically die throughout life so that we can get out of our own way and become something greater, sometimes sacrificing our self, our personal preservation, health, or sanity, perhaps Nietzsche’s life and death was just that: a process of self-overcoming toward self-sacrifice toward something greater. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1022))
- Nietzsche described it in this way: My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it . . . but love it. ([Location 1062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1062))
- Every decision you’ve made was the best and only decision you could’ve made at the time with the information you had and the state of mind you were in. And every condition of life that either these decisions led to or that are fundamental to life in general, you have no control over and cannot change. ([Location 1070](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1070))
- The true challenge and task of life, for Nietzsche, is to fall in love with what you are actually experiencing right now, as it is, in all the ways it is. He wrote: I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer. ([Location 1079](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1079))
- Ultimately, to experience the moments of treachery and loneliness, failure and disaster, loss and death, and all the tragedies that pervade existence, and to still say yes, I love it, is perhaps impossible in a specific case-by-case sense. ([Location 1090](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1090))
- But perhaps in certain moments of high enough spirits, sufficiently distanced from misfortune, it is possible to practice a certain love for the whole of it. And for Nietzsche, achieving this is the greatest affirmation of life, which can then be used to construct the lens through which we see the beauty in everything and more frequently arrive at that resounding yes. ([Location 1092](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1092))
- sometimes the only way to experience the beauty of things is to think about things in a beautiful way. ([Location 1096](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1096))
- Amor fati is a sentiment of willingness to accept at last the way things have gone and will go, to love a life that tries in almost every moment to make you hate it, and to still stare back at it and say yes, I love it. What’s scarier than an opponent who smiles while being beaten? ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1105))
- It encourages us to love the absurd uselessness for what it is, how it is, and to use it against itself and live anyway. In the words of Cioran: When all the current reasons—moral, esthetic, religious, social, and so on—no longer guide one’s life, how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness? Only by a connection with the absurd, by love of absolute uselessness, loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life. I live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing. ([Location 1164](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1164))
- “Don’t bend; don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.” ([Location 1278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1278))
- Kafka’s work embodies and reminds us, not that we wish to give up, but that despite all the problems, we wish to continue. We wish to struggle against the universe and forge our own way. We wish to honestly confront and connect over the absurd, however hard it may be. ([Location 1286](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1286))
- If we are not made with a specific purpose prior to existence, we create our purpose through our existence. In other words, through the choices we make and the actions we take in life, we create who we are and what life means. “Man,” Sartre said, “is nothing else but what he purposes, he exists only in so far as he realises himself, he is therefore nothing else but the sum of his actions, nothing else but what his life is.” ([Location 1310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1310))
- Our life is ultimately our life, and so long as we are not harming others in the process, we must create a life of our own meaning, determining our own objects of importance, committing to their pursuit, and reaping the significance and wonder of life along the way. ([Location 1327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1327))
- neither the human nor the universe are necessarily absurd on their own, but rather, their relationship is absurd. As humans, we exist with an innate desire for meaning, reason, and order, but yet, we simultaneously exist in a universe that appears to lack all of the above. ([Location 1359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1359))
- We may live strange, absurd lives in an indifferent universe, but rather than hopelessness, despair, or worst of all, suicide, we should accept life’s absurdity, make it our own, and overcome it. ([Location 1365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1365))
- just like the rock in The Myth of Sisyphus, at some point, we return to the bottom of the hill, leaving us to start anew. As a result of this constant inability to satiate our desire for ultimate meaning and truth, we can often find ourselves drudging over the seeming absurdity and futility of it all. However, Camus felt that even in the conflict of absurdity, we can be ok and still live happy lives. ([Location 1382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1382))
- the point is not to eliminate absurdity or find and defend some ultimate truth, but rather, it is to be conscious and appreciative of the things within the absurdity—to look for, find, and create things that are interesting and personally meaningful. ([Location 1387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1387))
- “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart.” ([Location 1393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1393))
- What use is finding or creating meaning in life if you cannot maintain and share it well with others? What use is it to understand how you or the world (maybe) works if every time you encounter someone else it throws everything off? Is it even possible to live well without being able to live well with others (in at least some sense)? The following essays take on these questions; questions that help us to understand the problem of other people. ([Location 1405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1405))
    - Note: Wht does this mean
- Everyone is experiencing the same dissonance of being, living their own story through the nauseating rollercoaster of ups and downs to nowhere. It is both banal and almost hollow to say that we should be compassionate and kind to others because of this. ([Location 1430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1430))
- It is a profound, noble act of humanity to use our awareness of our unawareness as a source of compassion and understanding for others and ourselves, as opposed to a source of disdain and bitterness—to use our unique conscious position to know how hard it is to be in a conscious position, and to acknowledge that everyone else is, in fact, also in one.

- hell is the imposed state of dependance and modification of one’s self according to the integration, approval, and satisfaction of other people’s perception. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1657))
- no one can know what life will be like tomorrow nor what such life may cause one to think or feel. However, one must move with it and live according to the present now. Out of this emerges what is perhaps Emerson’s most popular concept, known as self-reliance. ([Location 1740](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1740))
- Emerson believed that for the sake of one’s work and sense of self, the individual must rely on themselves alone and recognize that what they feel and think is real and legitimate. ([Location 1750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1750))
- However, perhaps the question one must ask here is: if all we can know and experience is our self, how can any life be lived fully if one denies themselves before even trying? If we hide or hinder ourselves out of the fear of rejection from others, are we not, in essence, rejecting our own self first; the only person we truly and inescapably have to live with? Emerson’s work is a reinforcement and reminder of the importance of preventing this loss of self. It can help us attempt to live in the spirit of individuality, to raise the sail of one’s own ship and use the unknowable force of the wind, always moving forward, finding beauty in the vastness that surrounds us, and creating our self anew.

- When we consider somewhat often and hard that at some point none of this will matter and that it will all be lost, we shine a proportionally bright light on what does matter right now. ([Location 1926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0B6YYD5C9&location=1926))
- There is no telling if or what comes after death, there is no telling when it will come for you, but you can know that you are alive right now. To fully enjoy the present moment as often as you can and in as many ways as you can, to fall in love with a person, a thing, a moment, yourself, to make the most of everything despite knowing that you will lose it all to nothing, is more than enough heroism. What’s worse than living a life knowing that one will die is living a life knowing that one will die without having lived as many moments as one can properly relishing in the fact that they have not yet died.

- In every exhalation, there is a breath to come so long as we keep breathing. In every moment of hardship, pain, confusion, or weakness, there is a story taking place filled with the potential for triumph and vitality worthy of tears bursting with wonder and fondness for life, so long as we keep moving. So long as there is life in us, there is the rare and exclusively human opportunity to take this chaotic, thrashing existence, this strange nothingness, and make it something. There is the chance to connect and love and help, to feel and think and live, to experience the cosmic everything. And at some point, perhaps that is enough.
