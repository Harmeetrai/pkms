# Negative Mindset

This is a mindset where all you see is negative things 10 miles down the road. It's like the analogy that you say that you haven't seen any red cars, but then you see a lot of them as your mind is only fixated on that. In terms of having a [[noble pursuit]], don't worry about the [[stop worrying|negative things that could happen down the line]].
