## Highlights
- Start reading non-fiction and apply it in your life. Work on your physiology, it should be the foundation for productivity and discipline. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajdc12yacd4h3r7xp85mf7))
- Lessen the amount of superstimuli in your life to get more dopamine (motivation). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajdhjvmsg4pf61k3tq24rz))
- Flow activities should be the goal in life, not mind numbing pleasure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajdse9sqph1zrkkaz5ngp3))
- Start a bullet journal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajdxbe7swzsak6599rtkvn))
- DON'T TRUST MOTIVATION. Motivation is good if it's there but it shouldn't be the foundation of the habits you create. Why? because motivation isn't always there, and when it's gone you also lose the habits that you build on top of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzaje6j863a1epey9k31x386))
- Books that have had a profound impact on my life are; Mini habits, Meet Your Happy Chemicals, The HeartMath Solution, The Willpower Instinct, Cupid's Poisoned Arrow, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience and Awareness Through Movement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajf5sr6m50efd9eycw2c0g))
- Feeling good overall, in your body and mind, is required for doing productive things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajfm8brp77vj8aths00741))
- Dopamine is the key player here. Most people think dopamine is responsible for 'pleasure'. This is a big misunderstanding. Dopamine is actually responsible for 'wanting' and motivation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajg08b257amtspzaxeysdc))
- Exposure to high dopamine for longer periods of time REDUCES DOPAMINE RECEPTORS. Lower dopamine receptors give you lower motivation, lower concentration and less mental sharpness. With there being a lot of supernaturally high dopamine giving activities and substances available to us we should all be aware in what amount we should consume them. This is the reason why there are more college and university dropouts more than ever before. Why so many people are unhappy at work. And why there are more cases of depression than ever before (depression is linked to lower dopamine). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajqtbprex0daq8m52fjmv8))
- 1 book that has made a profound impact on my life is the book Flow, The Psychology of Optimal Experience. The idea of the book is that there are certain activities that for which your brain needs 100% of it's power to be focused on the activity. This is when you reach a 'Flow state'. In this state you lose the idea of the self, you lose track of time and are only focused on the task at hand. For example when you drive somewhere and you get there and don't remember how you got there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajgwq8vf0ktc6ar4v8p71s))
- Flow occurs when your skill matches the challenge of the activity. When your skill is too high, you will be bored, when the challenge is too high you will be anxious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajh92qyerbp0pzn9h6q8h2))
- One of the best habits I have build is journaling. More specifically bullet journaling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajj3ksa0cw4xyswx372fbt))
- My method: I have a simple notebook where I use the left and right page for 1 day ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzajmfyvwak8cd5f9npjr356))
    - Note: left page is for morning notes (tasks need to be complete, reflections) and right page for activities I did (green for positive and red for negative)
