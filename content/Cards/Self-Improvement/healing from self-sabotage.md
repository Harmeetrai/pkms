Overcoming self-sabotage is not just a matter of understanding why you’re holding yourself back; it is being able to take action in the direction that you want and need to, even if it is initially uncomfortable or triggering 

- We often don't need to be told what to do. We know what we want to do, and we know what we need to do. 
	- It is simply that we are being held back by our [[Cards/Self-Improvement/fear of yourself|fear of feeling]]. 
- To begin to unravel this emotional holding pattern, we can work through the following to find more ease and space and freedom while we change our lives.
	- You may feel as though you are worthless, but you most certainly are not. You may feel as though there is no hope, but there most certainly is. You may feel as though everyone dislikes you, but that is probably a gross over-exaggeration. You may think everyone is judging you, but that is a misperception.
		- By using logic and vision to guide ourselves, we are able to identify a different and better life experience. 
		- When we imagine this, [[inner peace|we feel peaceful and inspired]]. To rise up to meet this version of our lives, we must overcome our resistance and discomfort. We will not feel happy *initially,* no matter how “right” for us those actions are.
- Our mental and emotional growth follow a similar process. 
	- We are in pain because though we must change our lives, we are holding onto baggage and debris from the past. 
	- As we carry unresolved emotions from day to day, we gradually move our past trauma into our future lives
- Recovering from self-sabotage always necessitates a process of [[letting go]].
- When you only find happiness and peace after you’ve fixed every flaw, mastered every challenge, and are living decidedly in the “after” part of the picture of your life, you have not resolved anything.
	- You have only reinforced the idea that you cannot be okay until everything is [[perfectionism|perfect]].

Remaining attached to your old life is the first and final act of [[self-sabotage]], and releasing it is what we must prepare for to truly be willing to see real change.
