# 🎥 journey before destination

- ℹ️ What is the video going to be about?
	- about finding ones purpose and meaning in life
	- embarking on new advantures and taking on new challenges in life
	- are we just going through life or are we living it
- 👨‍👩‍👦 Who is my ideal viewer for this video?
	- someone who is lost in life and can't find any direction (mostly young adults)
- ❔ Why should they watch this video?
	- they can find a new way of thinking in life, they would want to search within themselves to find their own meaning through their own hardships.
	- they see that everyone, including me is fundamentally flawed, that we just need to do our very best and move forward in life. Maybe there is no purpose, so one could create their own. Forge their own path forward.
