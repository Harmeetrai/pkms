# The Four Agreements
---

- [[2 types of dreams]]
- [[how do we live our lives]]
- [[the inner judge]] 
- [[dream of hell]]
- [[search for truth]]
- [[fear of living]]

## First Agreement: Be Impeccable with Your Word
---
This is the most difficult one to honor. [[be impeccable with your word]]. Your word is the power that you have to create. Through the word you express your creative power. Use the word to share love, kindness. Don't let negative words in. Tell yourself postive things, then you will be a postive person. Don't let poison in.

## Second Agreement: Don't Take Anything Personally
---
All people live in their own minds (dreams). They perceive the world completely different from you. When [[don't take things personally|we take things personally]], we make the assumption that they know what is in our world and we try to impose our world into theirs.
## Third Agreement: Don't Make Assumptions 

## Fourth Agreement: Always Do Your Best

## The New Dream
