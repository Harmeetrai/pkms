# Psychoacoustic Model
---
- Basically: If you can’t hear the sound, don’t encode it
	- Frequency range is about 20 Hz to 20 kHz, most sensitive at 2 to 4 KHz.
	- Dynamic range (quietest to loudest) is about 96 dB
	- Normal voice range is about 500 Hz to 2 kHz
- Suppose we play two pure tones, sinusoidal sound waves, with the same amplitude but different frequencies. 
	- Typically, one may sound louder than the other. The reason is that the ear does not hear low or high frequencies, as well as it hears frequencies in the middle range. 
	- In particular, at normal sound volume levels, the ear is most sensitive to frequencies between 1 and 5 kHz.
