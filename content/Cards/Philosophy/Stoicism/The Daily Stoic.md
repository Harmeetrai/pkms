# Discipline of Perception


## Clarity
- [[control and choice]]: "The main task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Good and evil is rooted ito our choices and actions of what we control" - [[Epictetus]]
-  [[education is freedom]]: "Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated - tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. Only the educated are free" - [[Epictetus]]
## Unbiased Thought
- [[the color of your thoughts]]: "Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions" - [[Marcus Aurelius]]
- [[be wary of what you let in]]: "Drama, combat, terror, numbness, and subservience - everyday these things wipe out your sacred principles, whenever your mind enterains them uncritically or lets them slip in" - [[Marcus Aurelius]]

- [[Don't let success go to your head]]: "Make sure you're not made 'Emperor,' Keep yourself simple, good, pure, saintly, plain,a friend of [[justice]], god-fearing, gracious, affectionate, and [[strong]] for your proper work. Fight to remain the person that philosophy wished to make you. Revere the gods, and look after each other. [[Life is short]] - the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good" - [[Marcus Aurelius]] 
- [[prepare yourself for negativity]]: "When you wake up, tell yourself this: 'I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks.' They are all stricken with these afflictions because they don't know the difference between [[good and evil, look at your choices|good and evil]]. Because I have understood the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil, I know that these wrong-doers are still akin to me and that none can do me harm or implicate me in ugliness - nor can I be angry at my relatives or [[hate]] them. For we are made for [[cooperation]]" - [[Marcus Aurelius]]
- [[expect to change your opinions]]: "There are 2 things that must be rooted out in human beings: arrogant opinion and mistrust. Arrogant opinion expects that there is nothing further needed and mistrust assumes that under the torrent of circumstance there can be no [[happiness]]" - [[Epictetus]]
- [[the cost of accepting counterfeits]]: "When it comes to [[money]], we do our absolute best to check and test whether the currency is real, providing great attention. But when it comes to our own ruling principle, we yarn and doze off, accepting any appearance that flashes by without counting the cost" - [[Epictetus]]
- [[judments cause disturbance]]: "It isn't events themselves that disturb people, but only their judgements about them" - [[Epictetus]]

- [[less is more]]: "Don't act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a contrarian. Don't everdress your thoughts in fine language. Don't be a person of too many words and too many deeds. Be cheerful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring. A person needs to stand on their own, not propped up." - [[Marcus Aurelius]]
- [[becoming an expert in what matters]]: "Believe me, it's better to produce the balance-sheet of your own life than that of the grain market" - [[Seneca]]

Observer those who you praise without prejudice. The just or the unjust? The just. The even-tempered or undisciplined? the even-tempered. The self-controlled or the uncontrolled? The self-controlled. In making yourself that kind of person, you will become beautiful - but to the extent you ignore these qualities, you'll be ugly, even if you try look beautiful on the outside" - [[Epictetus]]
- [[how to have a good day]]: "God laid down this law, saying: if you want some good, get it from yourself" - [[Epictetus]]

Therefore, if you want to do something, make a [[habits]] of it. Same principle is at work in our state of mind. When you get angry, you've not experienced that evil, but you're reinforcing a bad habit, adding fuel to the fire" - [[Epictetus]]
