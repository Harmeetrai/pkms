## Highlights
- The shortcut is a lie ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzane7ezc47ghd6pra5wgy68))
- To reach goals and overcome obstacles
  and become the best version of you possible
  will not happen by itself. It will not
  happen cutting corners, taking shortcuts,
  or looking for the easy way.
  THERE IS NO EASY WAY. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzaneqnrn6skgcrs3hwf42zt))
- Discipline: The root of all good qualities.
  The driver of daily execution. The core principle that overcomes laziness and lethargy and excuses. Discipline defeats the infinite excuses that say: Not today, not now, I need a rest, I will do it tomorrow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanfbj53pp2vm078pj2qx9g))
- Discipline comes from within.
  Discipline is an internal force. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanhp8nf2t8en4hbyntwcxy))
- What you are looking for,
  what you need, is SELF-DISCIPLINE.
  Self-discipline, as the very term implies,
  comes from the SELF. YOU.
  It comes when you make a decision to be disciplined.
  When you make a decision to be better.
  When you make a decision to do more, to BE more.
  Self-discipline comes when you decide to make a mark on the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanja925trzvgcrwjtdq6m4))
- Become the discipline—embrace its cold and relentless power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanjz8tna1mdjjx431216tt))
- You want to improve?
  You want to get better?
  You want to get on a workout program or a clean diet or start a new business?
  You want to write a book or make a movie or build a house or a computer or an app?
  Where do you start? You start right HERE.
  When do you start? You start right NOW.
  You initiate action.
  You GO ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanm2hacph9wvqwsvf8fce2))
- YOU HAVE TO DO IT. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanmb3h0v5jee6nq6tqd7jk))
- Learn from their weaknesses. Of course: Learn from their strengths and mimic and copy them in what they do well. But equally as important: Learn from their faults ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanndt9y7cf8c13akweyxbd))
- The only person you can control is you.
  So focus on making yourself who
  you want you to be: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzannrm3ez111bmcbfg6b4my))
- Faster. Stronger. Smarter. More humble. Less ego.
  Discipline your body. Free your mind. Get up early, and go.
  Get after it and you will become the person you want to be ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanp4kpnd3vsvq48hpbgbyq))
- You, your mind, the thing that is reading and comprehending these words right now, that IS YOU.
  And you can control it. You are the machine, and you can control it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanq7wbvj756517b69yv772))
- So next time you are feeling weak or lazy or soft or emotional, tell those feelings they don’t get a vote. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanrqccan99q6xxse462j01))
- You are declaring martial law on your mind:
  MIND CONTROL.
  Impose what you want on your brain:
  DISCIPLINE.
  POWER.
  POSITIVITY.
  WILL. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzansmg5s593z61mne7sxfay))
- Don’t let your mind control you ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzansxxzxsds07e3nsfz0jn7))
- I’m always fighting. I’m struggling and I’m scraping and kicking and clawing at those weaknesses—to change them. To stop them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzantwh05jdzwdtgngp7mrga))
- Some days I win. But some days I don’t.
  But each and every day: I get back up
  and I move forward.
  With my fists clenched.
  Toward the battle. Toward the struggle.
  And I fight with everything I’ve got:
  To overcome those weaknesses and those shortfalls and those flaws as I strive to be just a
  little bit better today
  than I was yesterday ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanvdrx63mzedqq8t9c7jpe))
- Gain perspective.
  And to do that you must do something critical in many situations: Detach.
  Whatever problems or stress you are experiencing, detach from them.
  Stress is generally caused by what you can’t control. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzanwxte4bmg65vdneh9mh1r))

- If the stress is something you can’t control: Embrace it.
  You can’t control it, but—
  How can you look at it from a different angle?
  How can you use it to your advantage?
  I couldn’t control the chaos of combat.
  I had to embrace it.
  I had to figure out a way to take advantage of it.
  Make it into your ally. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfw4rp11tks2zg9stp4ca9j))
- When it just doesn’t make any logical sense to go on, that’s when you use your emotion, your anger, your frustration, your fear, to push further, to push you to say one thing: I don’t stop.
  When your feelings are screaming that you have had enough, when you think you are going to break emotionally, override that emotion with concrete logic and willpower that says one thing: I don’t stop.
  Fight weak emotions with the power of logic; fight the weakness of logic with the power of emotion.
  And in the balance of those two, you will find the strength and the tenacity and the guts to say to yourself:
  I. DON’T. STOP.
  UNTIL THE END ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfw9grgb3feferb957y3wn5))
- BE RELENTLESS.
  Let the enemy stop. Let the enemy rest. Let the enemy finish.
  You? Don’t finish. Don’t stop. Don’t rest.
  Not until the enemy is completely destroyed.
  And even then … Turn your focus inward, on yourself, and take the opportunity not to rest …
  But to make yourself better, faster, smarter, stronger. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfwgm90m0kj1ad4hsyeemcs))
