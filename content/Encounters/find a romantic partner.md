# Finding a romantic partner
#on/Goals 

My goal for the longest time was to find a romantic partner, I thought that I would be happy if I found the right girl. But that's not the case, [[happiness]] is not found through external success. Strive for [[inner peace]] first. Become [[the better version of myself|the best version of myself]], then using that better version to give love fully. Although that is my goal, I am not going to wait around for that person to come to me, it is an active pursuit. In that [[noble pursuit|pursuit]] of finding peace and [[finding purpose]], I will keep my heart and mind open. I will accept the world as it is, the abundance I have for living each day. I will be [[gratitude|grateful]] for my time on this Earth and always put my purpose above anything else, including a romantic partner. Here are some steps I could take to actively pursuit and find love:


- [ ] [[self-care]]
	- [ ] meditate
	- [ ] avoid overstimulation from porn, use in moderation
- [ ] create a dating profile
	- [ ] take good pictures of myself
	- [ ] find a good caption and a "why" a person should like me
- [ ] meet people at SFU
	- [ ] cold approach girls I find attractive
- [ ] slide in dm's
	- [ ] upload instagram pictures and make my profile look attractive
	- [ ] ask girls out on dates, tell them I find them attractive
