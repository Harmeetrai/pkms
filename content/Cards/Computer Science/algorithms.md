# Algorithms
---
An algorithm is a set of steps that are followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task. Algorithms are a fundamental concept in [[computer science]] 

- [[sorting alogrithms]]: used to arrange data in a particular order, such as ascending or descending
- [[search algorithms]]: used to find a specific piece of data within a larger dataset
- [[graph algorithms]]: used to analyze and manipulate graphs and networks

## Analysis of Algorithms
Algorithms are usually represented in [[big O notation]]. It is important to analyze its time and space complexity. This can be done using various techniques, such as asymptotic analysis and empirical testing.
