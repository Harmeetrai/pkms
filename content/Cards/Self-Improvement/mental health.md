# Mental Health
---
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act, and helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.

Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Over the course of your life, if you experienceÂ mental health problems, your thinking, mood, behavior, and [[happiness]] could be affected.
