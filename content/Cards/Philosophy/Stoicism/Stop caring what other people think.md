- We can be immensely happy in our own lives, until we find out that someone we don't even like as more
- Or, we don't feel good about our accomplishments or talents until some third party validates them
- Take contol of our own opinions and don't control what other people think (let them think, we have no control over it)
- Don't spend time thinking about what others think
- think about what you think. Think instead about the results, about the impact, about whether it is [[the right thing to do]]

Caring about what others think is a natural and normal part of being human, and it can be difficult to completely stop caring about what others think. However, it is possible to reduce the impact that other people's opinions have on your life and to develop a greater sense of self-acceptance and self-confidence. Here are a few strategies that may help:

1. Practice self-acceptance: Accepting yourself, including your flaws and imperfections, can help you feel more confident and less concerned with what others think of you.
2. Focus on your own values and priorities: Rather than trying to please others, focus on what is most important to you and what aligns with your values. This can help you make decisions that are authentic and meaningful to you, rather than being influenced by others' expectations or opinions.
3. Set boundaries: It's important to be clear about what you are and are not comfortable with, and to communicate those boundaries to others. This can help you feel more in control of your life and less influenced by the opinions of others.
4. Develop a support system: Surround yourself with people who accept and support you for who you are, rather than judging or criticizing you. This can help you feel more confident and less concerned about what others think.
5. Find ways to cope with negative thoughts and feelings: If you find that you are still struggling with caring about what others think, it can be helpful to find healthy ways to cope with negative thoughts and feelings, such as through mindfulness, therapy, or other self-care practices.

Remember that it's okay to care about what others think to some extent, but it's important to find a balance and not allow other people's opinions to dictate your life or your self-worth.
