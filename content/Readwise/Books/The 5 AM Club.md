## Highlights
- “Ideas are worth nothing unless backed by application. The smallest of implementations is always worth more than the grandest of intentions. And if being an amazing person and developing a legendary life was easy, everyone would be doing it.

- World-class begins where your comfort zone ends is a rule the successful, the influential and the happiest always remember.” ([Location 148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=148))
- A major key to happiness—and internal peace—is knowing you’ve done whatever it took to earn your rewards and passionately invested the effortful audacity to become your best. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=157))
- “Anyway, let me simply say that the place where your greatest discomfort lies is also the spot where your largest opportunity lives. The beliefs that disturb you, the feelings that threaten you, the projects that unnerve you and the unfoldments of your talents that the insecure part of you is resisting are precisely where you need to go to.

- “Do not live as if you have ten thousand years left. Your fate hangs over you. While you are still living, while you still exist on this Earth, strive to become a genuinely great person.” —Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=194))

- Life’s way too valuable to hang with people who don’t get you. Who you just don’t vibe with. Who have different values and lower standards than you do. Who have different Mindsets, Heartsets, Healthsets and Soulsets. It’s a little miracle how powerfully and profoundly our influences and environments shape our productivity as well as our impact.” ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=310))

- gargantuan results are much less about your inherited genetics and far more about your daily habits. And your morning ritual is by far the most essential one to calibrate. And then automate. ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=381))
- Remember, every professional was once an amateur, and every master started as a beginner. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=388))

Makes me consider what the journalist Norman Cousins said: ‘The tragedy of life is not death but what we let die inside of us while we live.’” ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=452))
- They need to constantly be with other people to escape their feelings of self-hatred over all their wasted potential, missing the wonders and wisdom that solitude and quiet bring.

- We crave social approval. We want our peers to respect us. We hope our neighbors will like us. We buy all sorts of things we really don’t need and obsess about making money we really don’t enjoy.” ([Location 482](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=482))
- We learn to savor simple beauty, experience gratitude for small miracles, appreciate the priceless value of peace of mind, spend more time cultivating human connections and come to understand that the one who gives the most is victorious.

- Nothing works for those who don’t do the work. Less talk and more do is what I say. Oh, ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=617))
- “only people who are capable of loving strongly can suffer great sorrow,” ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=637))
- ‘Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead.’ ([Location 694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=694))
- ‘Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You don’t have to have a college degree to serve. You don’t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You don’t have to know about Plato and Aristotle to serve. You don’t have to know Einstein’s Theory of Relativity to serve. You don’t have to know the Second Theory of Thermodynamics and Physics to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.’” ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=734))
- “One of the big lessons I’ve learned over the years is that giving to other people is a gift you give to yourself. Raise the joy of others and you’ll get even more joy. Increase the state of your fellow human beings and, naturally, your own state of being ascends. Success is cool. But significance is rad. Generosity—not scarcity—is the trait of all of the great men and women who have upgraded our world. And we need leaders, pure leaders and not narcissists obsessed with their own self-interests, as never before.” ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077XCPTLT&location=738))
