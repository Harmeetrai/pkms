# You are not broken

- Fear and resentment rule the addictive mind, fear of what was and resentment with what is. Through this fear and resentment of one's self, we see ourselves as fundamentally broken
- What does it mean to be broken? It could be a breakup with the person you loved, or getting laid off from a job. This feeling gives the impression that one's self is not good enough, that I am not worth living for. I am just [[drifting through life]].
- We seek to escape our minds through the use of substances, such as alcohol and drugs, but also through high doses of [[dopamine]] such as phone or sex. "We use the external to escape the unbearable internal."

> Along with my positive qualities - intellectual confidence, strengths, passions, and commitments - there has always lurked near the very core of me a churning, inchoate anxiety ... My anxiety clothes itself in concerns about body image or financial security, doubts regarding lovability or the ability to love, self-disparagement, and existential pessimism about [[finding purpose|life's meaning and purpose ]]- or on the other hand it manifests itself as grandiosity, [[fear of living|the need to be admired]], to be seen as special. At the bottom it is nameless and formless. I feel sure it was forged in my chest cavity somewhere between my lungs and heart long before I knew the name of things.

- This [[anxiety]] never leaves cause we are never really aware of it. We say that if we got this job or make this much about of money, then we will be happy and this anxiety will go away.
- However, this anxiety won't go away since it has been engrained in us ever since we were born and we are rule by this [[book of law]]. We have been taught that if we work hard, then we will be enough.
- One must look inward to have [[inner peace]].

> When a person is encouraged to get in tough with and express his deepest feelings in the secure knowledge that he will not be rejected, criticized, nor expected to be different, some kind of rearrangement or sorting-out process often occurs within the mind which brings with it a sense of peace; a sense that the depths of the well truth have really been reached.

- [[compassionate curiosity]] can we used to look inward and [[be yourself|becoming yourself]]
- one must accept reality and one's self.
- [[how to break the cycle of fear and resentment]]
- steps to engage in [[compassionate curiosity]]
	1. [[label the thoughts and urges]]
	2. [[separate yourself from your thoughts and feelings]]
	3. [[evaluate the thoughts and urges]]
	4. [[re-create your life]]
- At the end of the day, you were never actually broken, it is those thoughts that lead you to believe so. It is the best you could have done with the tools you had during that time. It is time to let go and live the life you've always wanted.
