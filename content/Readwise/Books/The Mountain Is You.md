## Summary
There is nothing holding you back in life more than yourself.  If there is an ongoing gap between where you are and where you want to be—and your efforts to close it are consistently met with your own resistance, pain, and discomfort—self-sabotage is almost always at work.

On the surface, self-sabotage seems masochistic. It appears to be a product of self-hatred, low confidence, or a lack of willpower. In reality, self-sabotage is simply the presence of an unconscious need that is being fulfilled by the [[self-sabotage|self-sabotaging]] behavior. [[healing from self-sabotage|To overcome this]], we must go through a process of [[deep psychological excavation]].

It is no small task, and yet it is the work that all of us must do at one point or another. Your old self can no longer sustain the life you are trying to lead; it is time for reinvention and rebirth.

> In the end, it is not the mountain that you must master, but yourself.

## Self-Sabotage
[[self-sabotage]] is what happens when we refuse to consciously meet our innermost needs, often because we do not believe we are capable of handling them. 
- [[healing from self-sabotage|To truly heal]], you are going to have to [[examples of self-sabotage|change the way you think]]. You are going to have to become very conscious of negative and false beliefs and start shifting to a mindset that actually serves you.
- path you seek starts now
	- It is okay if you are starting at the beginning.
	- It is okay if you are at rock bottom and cannot yet see your way through.
	- It is okay if you are at the foot of your mountain and have failed every time you’ve tried to overcome it

## Taking action
Your life is ultimately measured by your outcomes, not your intentions. 

- It is not about what you wanted to do or would have done but didn’t have the time. 
- It’s not about why you thought you couldn’t; it’s just whether or not you eventually did. 

As scary as it might be to not be great at something initially, or perhaps even experience a loss, it is even worse to fail by virtue of never trying and always playing small. Failure is inevitable, but you have to make sure it’s happening for the right reasons.

- When we fail out of negligence, we take a step back. When we fail because we are attempting new feats, we take one step closer to what will work.
- Instead, we can acknowledge that when one part of our life improves, it radiates out to everything else. When we achieve one thing, we are better equipped for the future. 
- Life tends to gradually get better as we keep working on it; it only gets worse if we accomplish something then shut down because we are intimidated by our own power. 

[[just do it]], dont overthink, have [[discipline]], and create [[atomic habits]] as small progress each day compounds

## Feelings
Instead of trying to incite war on yourself to overcome your overeating, spending, drinking, sexing—whatever it is you know you need to improve—ask yourself what emotional need that thing is filling. Until you do, you will battle it forever. 

Our triggers do not actually exist just to show us where we are storing unresolved pain. In fact, [[why negative emotions are important|they show us something much deeper]].

- [[anger]] is a beautiful, transformative emotion, embrace anger within yourself. Anger allows you to recognize on what you have to change, what you have to do to be a better, happier person
- [[embarrassment]] is what we feel when we know that we did not behave in a way that we are proud of. 
- instead of [[resentment]], what we instead must do is reinvent our image of those around us or those we have perceived as having wronged us. Other people are not here to love us perfectly; they are here to teach us lessons to show us how to love them—and ourselves—better.
- [[regret]] is also another way that we show ourselves not what we wish we could have done in the past, but what we absolutely need to create going forward.
- [[self-love]]

### Fear
We have this weird thought that evokes a deep sense of dread, fear, and series of “doomsday” scenarios in your head. This is the [[Cards/Self-Improvement/fear of yourself]] You then keep coming back to it to the point that it even controls some part of your life.  

The [[spotlight effect]] is what happens when we imagine that our lives are performative, or “on display” for others to consume. Spotlighting gives us the false impression that the world is all about us, when it is not.

---
## Resistance
[[interal resistance|Resistance]] is your way of slowing down and making sure that it’s safe to get attached to something new and important. In other cases, it can also be a warning sign that something isn’t quite right, and you might need to step back and regroup.

---
## Perfectionism
When we expect that our work must be perfect the first time we do it, we end up getting into a cycle of [[perfectionism]]. This is very harmful as we don't [[just do it|take action]] on what needs to get done. We are always waiting for that perfect moment

---
## Self-doubt
- [[overcoming trauma]]
- [[what could've been]] and why we need to [[stop worrying]]
- [[trusting your gut instinct]]

---
## Self-mastery
When you look back on your life, you won’t remember the hardships. You’ll see them then as pivot points, growth opportunities, the days of awakening right before everything changed.

[[self-mastery]] is first to take radical and complete responsibility for your life. This includes even that which is beyond your control. A true master knows that it is not what happens, but the way one responds, that determines the outcome 

[[happiness]] is not something you can chase. [[Cards/Flow|It is something you have to allow]]. The world is so adamant about everything from positive psychology to motivational Pinterest boards. But happiness is not something you can coach yourself into. Learn to achieve [[inner peace]] and be present in the moment.

## Highlights

- The people who are meant for you are going to meet you on the other side. You’re going to build a new comfort zone around the things that actually move you forward. Instead of being liked, you’re going to be loved. Instead of being understood, you’re going to be seen ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3xjbhd68jqvbbg7wm25b4ep))

- Validating someone’s feelings doesn’t mean you agree with them. It doesn’t mean you concede that they are correct. It doesn’t mean that those feelings are the healthiest; it doesn’t mean they are informed by logic. Validating feelings does not mean you make them more true; it means you remind someone that it is human to feel things they don’t always understand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4am0em4k0a3383mcytx045d))
- When people are crying out or acting out in their lives, they aren’t just asking for help. They are most often just asking for someone to affirm that it is okay to feel the way that they do. And if they have to inflate and exaggerate circumstances for you to truly feel the weight and impact that they do? They’ll do it. They’ll do whatever it takes to get someone else to say: *I am so sorry for what you are going through*. This is not because they are incompetent or dumb. It is because in a world that does not teach us how to adequately process our own feelings, we must often rely solely on our maladaptive coping mechanisms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4am1d2ka4q8msv90nrnqmxn))
- Validating your feelings” sounds like a big term, but it really means one thing: It’s just letting yourself have them.
  When you are healing past trauma, often a big component is allowing yourself to experience the full expression of an emotion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4am4dczxfpedkn7jz08vzxm))
- Validating other people teaches us how to validate ourselves. And when we learn how to validate ourselves, we become stronger. We see that our emotions are no longer threats, but informants. They show us what we care about, what we want to savor, and what we want to protect. They remind us that life is fleeting, and challenging, and gorgeous. When we are willing to accept the darkness, it is only then that we find the light. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4am71sx1w73yndgvwkxpwp6))
- The good things that happen to us in life are like a magnifier. They show us where we still need to grow. True love shows us to ourselves. Money shows us to ourselves. Dream jobs show us to ourselves. The good, the bad, the desperately-needs-to-change-right-now.
  If you don’t have principles now, you won’t have them later. If you don’t have the money principle of living beneath your means, you won’t be able to do it when you have more money. If you don’t have the relationship principle of not relying on others for your sense of self, it won’t magically resolve itself when you meet the “right person”; you will only sabotage that relationship, too.

- If you actually put your energy toward learning to be productive, taking care of your health and wellness, improving your relationships and self-awareness, you’d have a radically different life experience. Every single one of those things is within your ability to change or at least influence greatly.
  There are some things in life that are outside of your control. If you focus on them, you will miss something really important: the majority of your life is the direct result of your actions, behaviors, and choices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4fkcybam00z8aes31kw1hyd))
- Your life is not over. You did not fail indefinitely, but you will if you never let go and try again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4fkevygpsrf1464yssjwac0))
- Sometimes, we need an objective third party to help us sort through complicated parts of life. Keeping it all buried in your head and heart often makes it worse. Letting it out into the open tends to simplify the problem, release the emotion, and help you move on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4fkfav8smx3a4b1qbv2fant))
