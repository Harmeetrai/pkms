# compassionate curiosity

This is used to empathically investigate one's self without judgement or criticism. In order to truly look inward, one must [[seek discomfort]] and be vulnerable to life. One must let go of past addictions and old mindsets and seek to be open to what's truly deep down, in the void of one's self.
