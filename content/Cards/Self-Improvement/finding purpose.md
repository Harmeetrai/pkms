# Purpose

Sometimes we get lost in finding our purpose. Why we are here? Whats the meaning of life? I would suggest that purpose is you. You are born into this world alone and will die alone. You have to live with that fact. Sometimes we need to let go of whats holding us down, be in a state of [[Cards/Flow|Flow]]. Your purpose may change from time to time, but never stop working on yourself. Trust yourself that you will do whats [[noble pursuit|right, good, and noble]]. 

A good life is built from the inside out and is based on a foundation of [[self-improvement|self-conduct and prioritization]]. It’s not as dreamy as a vision board, but it’s a lot more effective. If you don't know what you want in life, you will be [[drifting through life|endlessly drifting through it and not living it]]. In order to achieve [[freedom]], we must be able to think for ourselves and let go of the [[fear of yourself]] and [[fear of others]]

- Your purpose today may have been to offer someone a smile when they were at their lowest.
- Your purpose this decade may be the job you’re in. 

When you realize that you are always impacting the world around you, you start to realize something: The most important thing you can do to live meaningfully is to [[self-care|work on yourself]]. To consciously become the [[best version of yourself|happiest, kindest, and most gracious version of yourself]]. By becoming the [[best version of yourself]], you are uplifting others to do the same. You will bring out the best in others and made an impact.

[[seek discomfort|Comfort and complacency is not an option]]. They realize they must become the heroes of their own lives and the creators of their own futures. At the end of your life, your purpose will be defined not by how you struggled, what circumstances you were in, or what you were supposed to do, but how you responded in the face of adversity, who you were to the people in your life, and what you did each day that slowly, in its own unique way, changed the course of humanity
