# Numerical Analysis
---
Numerical analysis is a subfield in [[discrete math]] and is the [[algorithms numerical analysis|study of algorithms]] for computing approximate solutions to problems from continuous [[mathematics|mathematics]]. It is the study of numerical methods that attempt at finding approximate solutions of problems rather than the exact ones.

Numerical Analysis involves 3 fundamental ideas
- [[algorithms]]
- [[calculus]]
	- [[taylor polynomials]]
	- [[linear algebra]]
- [[approximation]]

## Study of Errors
---
[[round-off errors]] arise because it is impossible to represent all real numbers exactly on a machine with finite memory

## Root-Finding Problem
---
The [[root-finding problem]] is the process of findding a root of an equation of the form $f(x) = 0$ for a given function $f$. A root of this equation is also called a **zero** of $f$
- [[bisection method]]: The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root.
- [[fixed-point iteration]]: A fixed point for a function is a number at which the value of the function does not change when the function is applied.
- [[newton's method]]
- [[secant method]]

## Solving Linear Systems
---
[[linear algebra]] is a key component in this section
- [[gaussian elimination]]

## Interpolation
---
Human brain and vision have a remarkable natural ability to recognize the patterns underlying graphical data. The purpose of [[interpolation]] is the get a best fit function.

- [[polynomial interpolation]]
- [[lagrange interpolation]]
- [[newton divided difference]]
- [[spline interpolation]]
