# Mastery by Robert Greene

A fantastic book on sculpting your mind and your life in the pursuit of mastery. Becoming the best in a craft, emulating the best practitioners in all fields throughout history.

>“Everyone holds his fortune in his own hands, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure. But it’s the same with that type of artistic activity as with all others: We are merely born with the capability to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.”

>— Johann WoldGang Von Goethe

### High Level Overview of Achieving Mastery

1. We enter a new field with excitement, but also fear about how much there is to learn ahead of us. The greatest danger here is boredom, impatience, fear, and confusion. Once we stop observing and learning, the process towards mastery comes to a halt.
2. But if we manage these emotions and keep pushing forward, we start to gain fluency, and we master the basic skills allowing us to take on bigger and better challenges.
3. Eventually, we move from student to practicioner. We use our own ideas and experiments, getting feedback in the process. We start to use our own style
4. Then as we continue for years we make the leap to mastery. We develop an intuitive sense of the skill and have mastered it to the point of being able to innovate and break the rules.

There are 3 phases to Mastery: 
1.  Apprenticeship
2.  Creative-Active
3.  Mastery

# Apprenticeship

Apprenticeship is a system for training a new generation of practitioners of a trade or profession with on-the-job training and often some accompanying study. Apprenticeships can also enable practitioners to gain a license to practice in a regulated occupation.

## Discover Your Calling

- we all posses a kind of inner force that seeks to guide toward your life's Task ([[finding purpose|your purpose]])
- the first move toward mastery is always [[self-mastery|inward]]
	- learning who you really are and reconnecting with that innate force
	- knowing yourself with clarity, the path will show and everything will fall in place
- its never too late to look inward and discover who you really are
