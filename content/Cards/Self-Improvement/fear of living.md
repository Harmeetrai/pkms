# Our Biggest Fear is Living

To be alive is the biggest fear humans have. Our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive and express what we really are. Just being ourselves is the biggest fear of humans. We have learned to live our lives trying to satisfy other people. We try to create this image is being [[perfectionism|perfect]], however, we can never fit this image. We find that we can never be perfect, so we reject ourselves. We cannot forgive ourselves for not being perfect. Nobody can hurt you more than yourself.

Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we reject ourselves; it is why we don't accept ourselves the way we are, and why we don't accept others the way they are. 

True transformation lies not in one’s external achievements, but in the relentless pursuit of [[self-mastery]]. Our biggest fear is being ourselves as we do our best to fit in and be good enough. We try to create this image of being perfect on the surface. However, perfection is unattainable so we punish ourselves for not being enough.

We cannot see who we truly are, we cannot see that we are not free. We live in this state of always trying to get the next big thing. The journey itself is not about the destination but about the pursuit of it. There’s beauty in the struggle.

There will be moments of triumph and defeats, like a mountain with highs and lows. Failure is just another stepping stone toward success. In these moments of failures and success, we find that true strength resides in the ability to rise, adapt, and persist.
