Manga is a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels that has gained widespread popularity around the world. The term "manga" is derived from the Japanese word "漫画," which means "whimsical pictures."

Manga has a long history in Japan, with the first manga-style comics dating back to the late 19th century. Today, it is a hugely popular form of entertainment in Japan, and it has a large and dedicated fan base around the world. Many manga series have been adapted into anime (Japanese animated television shows and movies), and they have also inspired a wide range of other media, including video games and live-action films.
