- your [[goal]] should be to turn what you what to be, to achieve that [[vision]]
- "one brings together sound teaching with sound conduct" - [[Musonius Rufus]]
- today or anytime you catch yourself wanting to condescendingly drop some knowledge that you have, grab it and ask:
	- _Would i be better saying words or letting my actions and choices illustrate that knowledge for me?_
