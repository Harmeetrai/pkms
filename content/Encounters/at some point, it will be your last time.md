At some point you will do everything for the last time. You will see your last sunset, taste your last bite of food, enjoy your last laugh, see everyone you know one last time, you will be you for the last time. There is nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. This is the true final destination in life. We must charge headlong into the absurdity, embrace the futility and live hard for nothing in every moment.
