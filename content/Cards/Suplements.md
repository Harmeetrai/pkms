Dietary supplements are products that are intended to supplement the diet and provide nutrients that may be missing or insufficient in a person's diet. They can be used to help build muscle mass and improve athletic performance, but it is important to use them in combination with a healthy diet and regular exercise program.

There are a wide variety of dietary supplements available, including [[protein]] powders, [[pre-workout]], and [[creatine]]. Some people use these supplements in the hope of:

1. increasing [[muscle mass]]
2. improving athletic performance
3. enhancing physical appearance. 

However, it is important to note that while supplements may be able to help support muscle building and athletic performance, they are not a substitute for a healthy diet and regular exercise.

It is also important to be cautious when using dietary supplements, as they are not regulated by the FDA in the same way that medications are. Some supplements may contain ingredients that are not listed on the label or may be contaminated with other substances. It is always a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider before starting to use any dietary supplement.
