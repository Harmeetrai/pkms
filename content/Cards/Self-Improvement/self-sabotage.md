# Self Sabotage

Self-sabotage is what happens when we refuse to consciously meet our innermost needs, often because we do not believe we are capable of handling them

Self-sabotage refers to the act of intentionally or unintentionally undermining one's own success, well-being, or goals. It involves engaging in behaviors, thoughts, or actions that hinder personal growth, achievement, or positive outcomes. This can manifest in various ways, such as procrastination, negative self-talk, avoiding opportunities, undermining relationships, or engaging in self-destructive habits.

Self-sabotage often stems from underlying psychological factors, such as [[Cards/Self-Improvement/fear of yourself|fear of failure]], low self-esteem, perfectionism, or a lack of self-confidence. People may engage in self-sabotaging behaviors as a way to protect themselves from potential disappointment or to maintain a sense of control, even if those behaviors ultimately lead to negative consequences.

Recognizing self-sabotage is an important step toward addressing and overcoming it. This can involve developing self-awareness, [[psychic thinking]], identifying patterns of behavior, challenging negative thoughts, seeking support from others, and practicing healthier coping strategies. Therapy, counseling, or self-help resources can also be valuable tools in addressing and overcoming self-sabotage tendencies.

There is nothing holding you back in life more than yourself.

When you’re in a pattern of self-sabotaging behavior, you’re often treating those excuses the same way you would treat measurable outcomes: You’re using them to make yourself feel momentarily satisfied, using them as a replacement for the accomplishment itself.
