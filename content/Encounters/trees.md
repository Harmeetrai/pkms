# Trees

- a node contains 
	- key
	- children (list of children nodes)
	- (optional) parent
- **root node** is the top node in the tree
- **child node** is the node directly below the **parent** node
- **ancestor** is the parent or parent of the parent, etc.
- **descendant** is child or child of child, etc.
- **sibling** is sharing the same parent
- **leaf node** is a node with no children
- **interior node** is the non-leaf node, but not the root node
- **height** is the maximum depth of subtree node and farthest leaf
- **forest** is a collection of trees
