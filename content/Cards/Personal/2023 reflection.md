# 2023

A lot has happened over this year, and it might be the year where I experienced the most hardships, sadness, loneliness. A very difficult year for me, however, difficult times and struggles are needed to become a stronger person. In fact, this year I have improved a lot. I know more and have a better sense of meaning and purpose. Though I don't have everything figured out, I am starting to piece things together. 

### Health

- body: 8/10
	- This year has been okay in terms of health. I have been hitting the gym regularly, although I wish I bulked up during the summer. But I did get fairly lean. 
- mind: 5/10
	- I have also been more focused about my mind, been doing a bit of meditation and listening to peaceful music. Waking up very early in the morning also helped my mood. I have been reading a lot more, I believe that this is a really positive and transformative period in my life. I have read about 10 books, including the first 2 stormlight archive books. I want to pick up my reading pace and read a lot more books in [[2024]]
- soul: 2/10
	- I have been finding difficulty finding my purpose, or who I am as a person. Reading books as informed me of [[self-sabotage]], notably [[The Mountain Is You]]. I have also learned to rely on myself and make myself accountable for my actions. I have learnt that good actions makes a good person.

### Relationships

- family: 6/10
	- At the start of the year, I was very rude and ungrateful for my family. At that time, I was going through a lot of pain mentally and took some of that pain out on family. I need to be more grateful for them.
- romantic partner: 0/10
	- Well this did not go the way I planned. I have made 0 girlfriends and mostly destroyed my ego. I have gone down the path that no one likes me and that I'm hard to love. But im going to try even harder next year
- friends: 2/10
	- Did not make many friends this year, nor did I check up on some people. I did talk to 1-3 friends but thats about it. I did not go out with people and mostly stayed in doors. Next year I want to make more friends and find people who make me a better person

### Career

- growth: 10/10
	- I finished the 8 month internship at Redmane and proud of myself for completing it. I have learned a lot, but I mostly need to master the soft skills. I did make many mistakes that I took very hard on myself. I have also completed a semester at sfu, now there's only 1 remaining.
- mission: 5/10
	- I honestly don't know if i'll find a good software developer job once I graduate. I don't want to go back at redmane since I didn't like doing application config work. I want to build products, not configure them. 
- money: 7/10
	- Although I did earn a bit of money from the internship and did invest in the stock market. But I need to be careful of spending that money. I have bought many materialistic things such as iPhone, macbook, ps5, games. I need to learn to save a lot more and invest to be financially independent.
