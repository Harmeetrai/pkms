# Variable-Length Coding

Variable-length code is a code which maps source symbols to a variable number of bits. The equivalent concept in [[computer science|computer science]] is [[bit string]].

Variable-length codes can allow sources to be compressed and decompressed with zero error (lossless data compression) and still be read back symbol by symbol.
