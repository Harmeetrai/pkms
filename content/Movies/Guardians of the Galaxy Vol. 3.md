plot:: Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill rallies his team to defend the universe and one of their own - a mission that could mean the end of the Guardians if not successful.

This was a suprisingly great film by James Gunn. A lot of emotion and depth in characters. Each character was given a moment to shine. This film has a recurring theme of letting go of the past or moving on from trauma. We see that in rocket where he was brutally tortured, Starlord grieving the lost of Gamora. What makes this film special if that each character is supporting the team. They value friendship and would have each others bad. There is a sense of comradery. The villian is chasing [[perfectionism]] as he wants to build a perfect society no matter the cost. The team values that each person is imperfect. They have their flaws and weaknesses, thats what makes them who they are. They are fine with imperfection as they know that person is authentic. We see that as Drax's weekness is being stupid, but mantis does not care, she still loves him for who he is. The style, cinematography, action sequences, and set pieces are amazing. Giving this film a 9/10.
