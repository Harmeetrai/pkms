Sikhism is a monotheistic religion founded in the 15th century in the Punjab region of India. It is based on the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] and the nine Sikh gurus who followed him. Sikhism emphasizes the concept of one God and the unity of all humankind. It teaches that people should live their lives in accordance with the principles of truth, honesty, compassion, humility, and justice, and that they should strive to cultivate a personal relationship with God through meditation and prayer.

Sikhs believe in the cycle of reincarnation and the concept of karma, according to which one's actions in this life determine the nature of one's existence in future lives. They also place a strong emphasis on social justice and equality, and reject the caste system that has traditionally been a part of Hindu society. Sikhism is a distinct religion, but it also incorporates elements of Hinduism and Islam.

Sikhs follow the teachings of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], which is the holiest book in Sikhism. It is a collection of hymns and writings by the Sikh gurus and other saints, and is considered the eternal guru of the Sikhs. Sikhs also follow the Five Ks, which are five articles of faith that include 
- uncut hair (kesh)
- a wooden comb (kangha)
- a steel bracelet (kara)
- a sword (kirpan)
- special undergarments (kacchera). 
These articles of faith are seen as a way to show one's commitment to the Sikh way of life.
