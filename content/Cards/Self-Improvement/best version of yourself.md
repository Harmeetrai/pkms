The best possible version of yourself—the most [[love|loving]], [[kindness|kind]], [[productivity|productive]], and [[self-awareness|self-aware]] version—is who you really are. Everything else is the byproduct of coping mechanisms you’ve developed and picked up from other people.

You might think that this disconnects them from the moment, but the opposite is true. [[stop worrying|Worrying]] disconnects you from the moment. Overthinking disconnects you from the moment. When you are consistently sidelined from your own [[anxiety]], it’s because you don’t have a plan regarding the thing that’s making you scared. In order to become the best version of yourself, you need to plan and stick to that plan by using [[just do it|action]], [[discipline]], [[self-control]]
