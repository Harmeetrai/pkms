# Worrying
---
Worrying excessively is not a malfunction. You are not of lesser character because you can’t “just stop” and “enjoy life.” Worrying is a subconscious defense mechanism. It’s what we do when we care about something so much we are equally terrified that it could hurt us, so we prepare to fight for it.

Worrying is so primal in the way that it fulfills a deep need within us to feel as though we’ve conquered, and thus are protected and saved. Yet at the same time, our discomfort with it is a higher aspect of ourselves informing us that it isn’t necessary, and in fact, it’s holding us back from the people we want and are meant to be.

## How to stop worrying
- What is the exact opposite of your fear? That’s what you want. That’s what you want so much that you’d go to the ends of your sanity to defend it. There’s nothing wrong with you for thinking this way, but there’s also nothing wrong with you for being ready to move in a new direction.
- Rather than spending your time rehearsing how much you’d panic [[what could've been|if such-and-such a situation were to come to fruition]], imagine how a third party would handle it if they were in your shoes. Imagine getting to the other side of the issue, perhaps even treating it as an opportunity to create something you otherwise couldn’t.
- Rather than spending your time shrinking yourself and your life out of fear of potentially confronting some kind of hardship, work on developing your [[self-esteem]] and know that even if you were to fail, you wouldn’t be judged, exiled, or hated in the [[Cards/Self-Improvement/fear of yourself|way you fear]]
- There’s a better way to feed your emotional hunger, and it’s not fighting yourself for your own [[inner peace]].
- Jumping to the worst-case scenario because you aren’t thinking clearly, and then you are engaging your fight-or-flight response because the worst-case scenario makes you feel threatened. This is why you obsess about that one, terrifying idea. Your body is responding as though it’s an immediate threat, and until you “defeat” or overcome it, your body will do its job, which is to keep you in defense mode, which is really a heightened state of awareness to the “enemy.”
- So often in life, our biggest anxiety comes not from what’s actually happening, but how we think about what is happening. In that, we reclaim our emotional freedom and power
