# Virtue

Virtues are character traits or qualities that are considered morally good. They are values that we aspire to embody and cultivate in our lives. Virtues are important because they help us to live a fulfilling, meaningful, and ethical life.

## Stoic Virtues

[[stoic virtues|A stoic of virtue]] would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy", thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole". This viewpoint was later described as [[Classical Pantheism]]
