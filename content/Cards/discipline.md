#note/developüçÉ 

True freedom is achieved through discipline, as it shows that one has control over his/her mind. Humans aren't meant to be [[seek discomfort|comfortable]], we need a [[noble pursuit]]. Life is a journey, a constant battle to reach higher with ups and downs.

Self-discipline is crucial to achieving optimal health (physical and mental) and living a happy life. I believe that humans aren't meant to be [[seek discomfort|comfortable]]. We need to have a noble pursuit. We recognize that life is a journey, a constant battle to reach higher with many ups and downs. 

With this pursuit of climbing higher, we find [[inner peace]] and build a stack of undeniable proof that shows who I am. While continuing on this journey called life, learn to appreciate the beauty around you. Take a stop once in a while to truly look at your surroundings. Be [[gratitude|grateful]], one day it won't be there.

## Seek discomfort
- What is the point if not [[net positive|making progress in life]], remember, the goal is always to complete the mission‚Äîwhatever it may be‚Äîwith no [[regret]] and a clear head, so you can use it to progress in life.
- A prepared mind [[seek discomfort|craves the worst conditions]] because it knows that pressure brings out its best and exposes almost everyone else
- If you stay where you‚Äôve always been, you will never learn if you have what it takes to venture into the deep water, there is never a time in your life where you should give in to that autopilot mentality.
