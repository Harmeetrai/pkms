## Highlights
- While happiness itself is sought for its own sake, every other goal—health, beauty, money, or power—is valued only because we expect that it will make us happy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfxnv3rnnspe6nm33f6ypha))
- regardless of all the stupendous scientific knowledge we can summon at will, people often end up feeling that their lives have been wasted, that instead of being filled with happiness their years were spent in anxiety and boredom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfy29pbe6xx9y4w01xaqtdz))
- happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfy4jb1ngbk01c6nwd2gab4))
    - Note: Happiness is something that must be actively worked towards and cannot be bought or commanded. It is an internal state of being determined by how we interpret events and is not dependant on external factors. To be truly happy, each person must take the time to cultivate and defend their own happiness.
- Man’s Search for Meaning: “Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzfy8qm03pzpv6ktdd2c0h5r))
    - Note: Gotta read man's search for meaning

- So how can we reach this elusive goal that cannot be attained by a direct route? My studies of the past quarter-century have convinced me that there is a way. It is a circuitous path that begins with achieving control over the contents of our consciousness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsv2mn2cx1yq9h3tbk4ffek))
    - Note: Have control over your mind
- We cannot decide—at least so far—how tall we will grow, how smart we will get. We can choose neither parents nor time of birth, and it is not in your power or mine to decide whether there will be a war or a depression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsv45sj66w8eqz21d6wqgry))
- we feel a sense of exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished and that becomes a landmark in memory for what life should be like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsv53y2m5f7x5bjkzzewrsp))
- The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen. For a child, it could be placing with trembling fingers the last block on a tower she has built, higher than any she has built so far; for a swimmer, it could be trying to beat his own record; for a violinist, mastering an intricate musical passage. For each person there are thousands of opportunities, challenges to expand ourselves. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvaxfcm7ax3khhxqmdhp1d))
    - Note: Happiness is found through difficult times
- the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvdznc2b9tfd5f2ze4hbe8))
- The concept of flow has been found useful by psychologists who study happiness, life satisfaction, and intrinsic motivation; by sociologists who see in it the opposite of anomie and alienation; by anthropologists who are interested in the phenomena of collective effervescence and rituals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvjc20kj89n3qxfjp63dmq))
- What I “discovered” was that happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to being happy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvqj3mxvjp19vxq2vys4jq))
- it. “Ask yourself whether you are happy,” said J. S. Mill, “and you cease to be so.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvr4qnqhvsmkfmyyefs707))
- Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue…as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than oneself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gzsvrtnsj2fvxz25fcfn9vdj))

- Unlike so many other nations in the contemporary world, we can’t blame our problems on a harsh environment, on widespread poverty, or on the oppression of a foreign occupying army. The roots of the discontent are internal, and each person must untangle them personally, with his or her own power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130gpt48xs8g3eec8v6hgw4))
- The lack of inner order manifests itself in the subjective condition that some call ontological anxiety, or existential dread. Basically, it is a fear of being, a feeling that there is no meaning to life and that existence is not worth going on with. Nothing seems to make sense ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130hkzbs544f5cymd38k2z7))
- Your time is up, it’s time to move on. When this happens, few people are ready. “Wait a minute, this can’t be happening to me. I haven’t even begun to live. Where’s all that money I was supposed to have made? Where are all the good times I was going to have?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130k9f6dej8kf7d2zc0jv23))
- sooner or later we wake up alone, sensing that there is no way this affluent, scientific, and sophisticated world is going to provide us with happiness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130mx9tj7743w1m947x29nx))
- Some try to ignore it, and renew their efforts to acquire more of the things that were supposed to make life good—bigger cars and homes, more power on the job, a more glamorous life-style. They renew their efforts, determined still to achieve the satisfaction that up until then has eluded them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130njbr7j09e4q29gq2bxqx))
- If the problem seems to be that nobody pays much attention, they buy books about how to get power or how to make friends, or they enroll in assertiveness training courses and have power lunches. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h130ppdbwzyeqzanq6vm46zs))

- To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life, individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13d4fy25zee2d8xdd1q69ea))
- develop the ability to find enjoyment and purpose regardless of external circumstances ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13d53rjxj80n886x6atehqa))
- achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13d5jx110bzkxyy65e2cahr))
- The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13d7tbzmbtrxwx0rna8v546))
- It is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. The pleasure we take in eating is an efficient way to ensure that the body will get the nourishment it needs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13datvhns4r32w4z4m0h064))
- The person who cannot resist food or alcohol, or whose mind is constantly focused on sex, is not free to direct his or her psychic energy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13dd4257rrkeea9chgbhf25))
