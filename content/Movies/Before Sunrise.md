plot:: A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna. Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.

Great film about [[romance]], both characters felt authentic and had real conversations with each other. Film talks about the meaning of [[love]] and why we need to let go of expectations of [[love]] (what my lover needs to do, they need to love my more) rather focus on loving in the moment. Time is precious, love is precious. Love in the moment.
