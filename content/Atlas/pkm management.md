# Meta PKM
Hi Future Self ðŸ‘‹  Here are "best practices" for managing your PKM system. 

## Folder Structure

Generally files are lowercased, excluding names. Folders are uppercased. I try to move encounters into their repectful folders in Cards, but if I don't see a fit, I just dump it in cards.

- `Encounters`: newly created notes
- `Atlas`: Top level notes
- `Cards`: All bottom-mid level notes. There are some folders insde to keep it organized. Generally, let the notes be loose here.
- `Extras`: Images/Media location, and templates
- `Journal`: Has my daily notes setup, there are 4 main journal notes
	- daily notes are used to capure moments/notes in everyday life
	- weekly notes are used to plan for next week and reflect
	- monthly notes are used to plan for next months goals and reflect on progress made
	- yearly notes are used for larger goals and steps to achieve it, implementing habits, try not to lose sight of these goals
