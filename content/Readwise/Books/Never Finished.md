## Mindset is Everything
- [[The Mountain Is You|Life is the mountain]] we are all climbing, but hope is not an anchor point. It’s too soft, fluffy, and fleeting. There’s no substance behind hope. It’s not a muscle you can develop, and it’s not rooted down deep. It’s an emotion that comes and goes.
- Anything was possible as long as I adopted a new [[mindset]]. I needed to become someone who refused to give in, who simply finds a way no matter what. I needed to become bulletproof, a living example of resilience.
- [[be impeccable with your word|The way we speak to ourselves in moments of doubt]] is crucial, whether or not the stakes are high. Because our words become actions, and our actions build [[habits]] that can coat our minds and bodies with the plaque of ambivalence, hesitancy, and passivity and separate us from our own lives.
- It will always be up to you to [[positive thinking|find the lesson in every shitty situation]] and use it to become stronger, wiser, and better. 
- Especially if you intend to thrive in a harsh world where you have to work for everything that matters. I’m not talking about material things. I’m talking about self-respect, [[self-love]], and [[self-mastery]].
- The rewards I seek are internal, and if you have that mindset, you will find [[student of life|opportunities for growth everywhere]]. During tough times, that growth can be exponential

## Journey before Destination
- Remember, the struggle is the whole [[Projects/Video/journey before destination|journey]]. That’s why you’re out there. It’s why you signed up for this race, or that class, or took the damn job. 
- There is great beauty when you are involved in something that is so hard most people want it to end.
- We all have the ability to be extraordinary, but most of us—and especially the haunted ones—tap out of the crucible and never experience what it’s like to get to the other side of hell.
- When you’re [[The Mountain Is You|climbing a mountain]] or involved in any other difficult task, the only way to free yourself from the struggle is to finish it. So why bitch about it when it gets hard? Why hope it will end soon when you know it will end eventually? When you complain and your mind starts groping for the eject button, you are not bringing your best self to the task, which means you are actually prolonging the pain.

## Acceptance
- [[self-sabotage|Denial is self-protecting]], but it’s also self-limiting. Accepting your full truth, including all your faults, imperfections, and missteps, allows you to evolve, expand your possibilities, seek redemption, and explore your true potential.
	- And until you unpack your baggage, it will be impossible to know what your potential really is. The whole truth can’t haunt you if it serves you. 
- You cannot be [[fear of others|afraid to disappoint people]]. You have to live the life you want to live. Sometimes, that means being the motherfucker who can [[fear of yourself|put a middle finger up to everyone]] in the room and be totally comfortable with that.
- Don’t be [[humility|afraid of your weakness]] or doubt. Don’t be embarrassed and pretend it doesn’t exist. It surfaced for a reason, so use it to flip the dynamic of your life.

## Seek Uncomfort
- Respect is earned every day by waking up early, challenging yourself with new dreams or digging up old nightmares, and embracing the suck like you have nothing and have never done a damn thing in your life
	- There are 86,400 seconds in a day. Losing just one of those seconds can change the outcome of your day and, potentially, your life.
- A prepared mind [[seek discomfort|craves the worst conditions]] because it knows that pressure brings out its best and exposes almost everyone else
- Remember, if you stay where you’ve always been, you will never learn if you have what it takes to venture into the deep water, there is never a time in your life where you should give in to that autopilot mentality.

## Mental Prison
* Have the courage and mental endurance to do whatever it takes to start knocking down those walls. You are the [[my life|warden of your life]]. Don’t forget you hold the keys.
- Breakdown is its own kind of mirror. Whatever you’re made of is laid out in front of you clear and plain. Your history and mindset become a weathered old map ridged with your scars, and if you read them like an archeologist on a dig, you might uncover the code you need to rise again and become better and stronger.
- There is no transformation without breakdown, and there is always another evolution, another skin to shed, a better or deeper version of ourselves waiting to be revealed.
	- First, you must recognize that you have fallen off or are perpetually falling short. 
	- Next, accept that you are on your own. Nobody will come save you. 
	- Then, you must become a disciple of discipline.

## Be Present
- The end will come when it comes, and anticipation will only distract you from completing the task in front of you to the best of your ability. 
- Every minute you spend feeling sorry for yourself is another minute not getting better, another morning you miss at the gym, another evening wasted without studying. 
	- Another day burned when you didn’t make any progress toward your dreams, ambitions, and deepest desires. The ones you’ve had in your head and heart your entire life.
- The only thing that ever matters is the [[be present|present moment]]. Yet too many people let their depression or regret hijack their day.
- Don’t feel sorry for yourself. Get strategic. Attack the problem. When you adapt, you will begin to see everything that comes your way as a stepping stone on your progression toward a higher plane.
- Incremental progress is still progress. One step is all that is required to take the next one.

## Humility
- [[humility|Humility]] is the antidote to self-pity. It keeps you rooted in reality and your emotions in check.
- Humility hardens your spine and encourages you to stand tall, secure in yourself no matter what anyone else thinks. And that has tremendous value.
- The way I see it, Master [[Sergeant William Crawford]] had figured it the fuck out. The Medal of Honor didn’t change him. He rose to prominence by staying [[humble]] and risking his own life to save others and retired into the service of others. It was never about him, and that gave him strength.
- When you are humble enough to remember that you’ll never know it all, each lesson you learn only makes you hungrier to learn more, and that will put you on a path that guarantees you will grow all the way to the grave.
	- Continued growth only comes when you are willing to be humble.

- Life is the mountain we are all climbing, but hope is not an anchor point. It’s too soft, fluffy, and fleeting. There’s no substance behind hope.

- I’d learned long ago that no matter what type of event or challenge I engage in, the only competition that ever matters is me against me. ([Location 1120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1120))

- You’ll need help too. You’ll need to find people who have survived or at least relate to what you’ve been through and can help you heal. ([Location 1377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1377))
- Have the courage and mental endurance to do whatever it takes to start knocking down those walls. You are the warden of your life. Don’t forget you hold the keys. ([Location 1390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1390))

- First, you must recognize that you have fallen off or are perpetually falling short. Next, accept that you are on your own. Nobody will come save you. They may show you an example, like Sgt. Jack did for me and I’m doing for you right now, but it will be up to you to do the work. Then, you must become a disciple of discipline. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1637))
- It’s so easy to be great nowadays because so many people are focused on efficiency: getting the most for themselves with the least amount of time and effort. Let all of them leave the gym early, skip school, take sick days. Commit to becoming the motherfucker with a never-ending task list. ([Location 1663](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1663))
- By learning to maximize what you do have, you will not only level the playing field but also surpass those born with more natural ability and advantages than you. ([Location 1665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1665))
- Nowadays, it doesn’t matter where you are from or who you are; if you are disciplined, there will be no stopping you. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1679))
- While I still didn’t like waking up early or most of the chores I had to do, those were the very things that turned me into someone I could be proud of. ([Location 1693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1693))
- It will always be up to you to find the lesson in every shitty situation and use it to become stronger, wiser, and better. No matter what comes down on your head, you must find a glimmer of light, remain positive, and never treat yourself as a victim. Especially if you intend to thrive in a harsh world where you have to work for everything that matters. I’m not talking about material things. I’m talking about self-respect, self-love, and self-mastery. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1713))

([Location 1793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1793))
- call this “trained humility.” It’s a shedding of your skin that allows you to take on a mission that no one else can see and do whatever needs to be done next. Trained humility is service but also strength. Because, when you are humble enough to remember that you’ll never know it all, each lesson you learn only makes you hungrier to learn more, and that will put you on a path that guarantees you will grow all the way to the grave. ([Location 1800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1800))

- Each time you level up, your mind will step in like an overbearing chaperone and try to shut down the party. That very dynamic was playing out in my own mind on the long drive. ([Location 1821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1821))
- A lot of us grow out of life’s shallow end but stay there because we fear the unknown. I’m thinking of those who remain in a secure job they hate instead of cutting ties and starting up their own business or applying for a new position elsewhere. ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1847))
- Remember, if you stay where you’ve always been, you will never learn if you have what it takes to venture into the deep water. ([Location 1852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1852))
- there is never a time in your life where you should give in to that autopilot mentality. ([Location 1986](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=1986))
- The rewards I seek are internal, and if you have that mindset, you will find opportunities for growth everywhere. During tough times, that growth can be exponential. ([Location 2041](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2041))
- Remember, the goal is always to complete the mission—whatever it may be—with no regrets and a clear head, so you can use it to progress in life. ([Location 2051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2051))
- Cultivating a willingness to succeed despite any and all circumstances is the most important variable of the reengagement equation. Your willingness to succeed builds self-esteem. It broadens your concept of your own capability, yet it is the first thing we lose touch with when things go bad. After that, giving up often feels like the sanest option, and maybe it is, but know that quitting chips away at your self-worth and always requires some level of mental rehab. Even if what forces you to quit is an injury or something else beyond your control, you will still have to bounce back from the experience mentally. A successful mission seldom requires any emotional maintenance. ([Location 2052](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2052))
- All I know is this: I am David Fucking Goggins. I exist; therefore, I complete what I start. I take pride in my effort and in my performance in all phases of life. Just because I am here! If I’m lost, I will find myself. As long as I’m on planet Earth, I will not half-ass it. Anywhere I lack, I will improve because I exist and I am willing.

- That’s why I ride that line: because those dark moments are rare, raw, and beautiful. ([Location 2170](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2170))
- If something surprises you in anything you are trying to accomplish these days, with so much free knowledge at our fingertips, it is because you didn’t prepare well enough, and there is no excuse for that. ([Location 2241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2241))

- Small minds and weak people kill big dreams. You might have clear goals and be working on yourself every day, but if you have the wrong folks around you, there’s a good chance they could be sucking the life right out of you and making sure that you go nowhere. ([Location 2257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2257))
- In order to populate your foxhole with the right people, you must first know who you are as an individual. That means shaking off old belief systems—creaky concepts of the world and your place in it—that no longer serve you and the habits and lifestyle that you’ve outgrown. ([Location 2283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2283))
- When there is no one around you who believes in or understands your quest, you must turn your foxhole into a one-man fighting position. That’s okay. It is always better to fight alone until you can find people strong enough to fight the good fight with you. There is no time to waste trying to pull deadweight up a hill. ([Location 2319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2319))
- Loneliness can be difficult and depleting, but I’d much rather you stay lonely than crawl out of your foxhole and trek back through known territory into the arms of the very people who loved the old you and were never comfortable with your transformation. ([Location 2322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2322))

- The only thing more infectious than a good attitude is a bad one. The more you dwell on the negative, the weaker you feel, and that weakness infects those around you. However, the reverse is also true. ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2415))
- Very few individuals step outside the box and attempt to stretch their limits. They rule out the spectacular by default. They put a hard cap on their own performance way before game day. ([Location 2458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2458))
- Locking eyes with the worst-case is always my starting point in any endeavor because it removes the fear of failure, prepares me for any and all outcomes, and keeps me leaning net positive from jump. ([Location 2467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2467))
- Whatever happens to us in life, we must aim to keep things net positive. When you have a shitty day, it’s tempting to call it an early night and try to forget about it, but if you go to bed in the red, chances are you’ll wake up that way, and all too often, that type of negativity snowballs. When your entire day is fucked up, make sure that you achieve something positive before lights out. You’ll probably have to stay up a bit later to read, study, get a workout in, or clean the house. Whatever it takes to go to bed in the black, get it done. ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2469))
- I am a student of life. I carry around a notebook. I keep logs. I study all the upswings and down currents of my days as if the final exam is tomorrow. Because we all have an exam tomorrow. Whether we realize it or not, every interaction, each task is a reflection of your mindset, values, and future prospects. It’s an opportunity to be the person you’ve always wanted to be.

- When you deliberately and consistently confront your fear of heights or particular people, places, and situations that unsettle you, those seeds germinate, and your confidence grows exponentially. ([Location 2627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2627))

- “I’m just a guy who believes in himself more than most. I am aware of what we are all capable of and that to get there, I have to harness every bit of power and energy I can. Power that is within all of us and all around us. I use your weakness as strength. I use your aggravation as strength. I ignite my competitive spirit with yours to get me moving even faster. Because if I can drop a hard motherfucker like you this deep into a race, what the fuck does that say about me?” ([Location 2681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2681))
- I practically spoke in tongues as I talked all kinds of shit to myself, to my demons, to the mountains, to the dark night sky, and to my North Star. “You don’t know me, son!” I howled. “You don’t know me, son!” ([Location 2702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2702))
- I desperately wanted to be somebody because I felt like a nobody. ([Location 2771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2771))
- Self-leaders rarely rest. In the heat of battle, they become dolphins who sleep with one side of their brain on alert and one eye always open so they are ready to outsmart, outswim, or battle their predators and they are awake enough to float back to the surface and take another breath. ([Location 2904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2904))
- They live for something bigger than themselves, and because of that, their lives swell and glow with an energy that others can feel. It can also start a chain reaction that challenges and awakens people to the untapped power coiled within themselves. The power that they are wasting with each passing day. ([Location 2907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2907))
- I live with a Day One, Week One mentality. This mentality is rooted in self-discipline, personal accountability, and humility. While most people stop when they’re tired, I stop when I am done. In a world where mediocrity is often the standard, my life’s mission is to become uncommon amongst the uncommon. ([Location 2936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2936))
- Principles give us a foundation—solid ground we can trust and build on as we continue to redefine what’s possible in our own lives. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2939))
- Don’t rely on some other group’s ethos or company’s mission statement to be your guide. Don’t walk around aimlessly trying to find purpose or fit in. Mine your core principles, and come up with your own oath to self. Make sure it is aspirational and that it challenges you to strive and achieve, and live by it every day. ([Location 2942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=2942))
- No matter what you are dealing with, your goal should be to maximize the resources and capabilities you do have. ([Location 3137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3137))
- You can work your ass off for decades, adapt, and evolve more than most, but no matter who you are or what you’ve done before, you cannot force something to fit. ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3260))
- greatness is a state of letting go of all your faults and imperfections, scavenging every last bit of strength and energy, and putting it the fuck to use to excel at whatever you set your mind to. ([Location 3314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3314))
- No matter how troubled or hopeless or sheltered your environment is, it is your job, your obligation, your duty, and your responsibility to yourself to find the blue-to-black line—that glimmer—buried in your soul and seek greatness. Nobody can show you that glimmer. You must do the work to discover it on your own. ([Location 3360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3360))
- Willing warriors don’t reach for excuses. While it’s human nature to try and talk yourself out of doing the hard or inconvenient thing, we know that it’s non-negotiable. ([Location 3412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3412))
- When you drop your head, you are sending a direct message to your brain that you don’t think you have what it takes to get better. That makes it much harder to focus and succeed. When you are working toward a goal that is important to you and things don’t go your way, never let anyone see it bring you down. Don’t give motherfuckers the satisfaction. When your head’s down, you can’t see where the fuck you need to go or what needs to be done. And if you need help, ask for it. Never be ashamed of it.

- there has got to be somebody in every family, neighborhood, culture, nation, and generation who breaks the mold and changes the way others think about society and their place in it. There has got to be someone willing to be an outlier. A savage who sees those walls and barriers that are constantly trying to close us off and divide us up and then breaks them down again by showing everyone what is possible. There’s got to be someone who demonstrates greatness and makes everyone around them think differently. Why not you?

- Whatever it takes for you to believe that you’re better than good enough to achieve your dreams is what you must do. And remember, your greatness is not tied to any outcome. It is found in the valiance of the attempt. ([Location 3678](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3678))
- In those rare, fleeting moments when you are washed in the sense of infinite possibility and overwhelmed with glory, everything they ever did to you or put in front of you—all the knockdowns, breakdowns, and fuck-yous and every bit of the pain, doubt, and humiliation—is fucking worth it. But the only way to get there is to continually seek greatness and always be willing to try one more time. ([Location 3706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3706))
- It is a lifelong quest for more knowledge, more courage, more humility, and more belief. Because when you summon the strength and discipline to live like that, the only thing limiting your horizons is you. ([Location 3712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0BJMN7RMV&location=3712))
