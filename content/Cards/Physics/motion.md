# Motion
---
The world, and everything in it, moves. Even seemingly stationary things, such as a roadway, move with Earth’s rotation, Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the Sun’s orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and that galaxy’s migration relative to other galaxies.

## Motion along a straight line
A change of a particle from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is called **displacement** $\Delta x$ (The symbol $\Delta$, the Greek uppercase delta, represents a change in a quantity, and it means the final value of that quantity minus the initial value.)
$$
\Delta x=x_2 - x_1
$$
**Average Velocity** $v_{avg}$ is the ratio of displacement $\Delta x$ that occurs during a particular time interval $\Delta t$
$$
v_{avg}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$
The average velocity is the area under the curve of distance travelled vs time:

**Average Speed** $s_{avg}$ is how fast a particle moves
$$
s_{avg}=\frac{\text{total distance}}{\Delta t}
$$
**Instantaneous Valocity** $v$ is the velocity at a give moment in time (it is the derivative of $x$ with respect to $t$)
$$
v = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$
When a particle’s velocity changes, the particle is said to undergo acceleration. The **average acceleration** $a_{avg}$ over a time interval $\Delta t$ is 
$$
a_{avg}= \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v_2-v_1}{t_2 - t_ 1}
$$
**Instantaneous acceleration** is the derivative of acceleration
$$
a = \frac{dv}{dt}
$$
