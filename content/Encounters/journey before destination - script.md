# 0. Starting montage/sequence
- Start off with a fast paced sequence of life (growing up, major milestones, the world combined with negativity and depression). Have clips of war, poverty, fame, power, politics, greed.
- transition from the sequence to me watching the sequence.
	- the projector light is hitting my face
- transition (with face alligned to me opening fridge to grab something to eat)
	- narration: what does it all mean? what does it mean to have a meaningless existence, to think nothing of yourself, to fear change. What does it mean to accomplish goals, why seek uncomfort? I was always afraid of change, I was afraid that I would lose my identity, and be judged. What will others think, fear kills dreams and hopes. Fear is the outcomes we determine down the line, every possible senerio we might lose. 

# Fear of change
- we are afraid of change, we want to live comfortable lives and stay that way
- it is engrained in human nature to strive for comfort as it is primal
- comfort kills hopes and dreams
- we often are ready to take that first step, however, the pull of social media and our negative identity stops us
- we compare ourselves to others, and our internal voice tells us to give up
- we think that lifes a race, that we are always behind
- we often think of all the negative outcomes that might happen

# Negative Identity
- when we where kids, we formed an identity of who we are
- these are societal rules, we can't draw on walls, hit people, steal
- these rules are good as they teach us how to become civilized and good people
- However, this is a double edged sword. Our identity tells us what is good or bad, what we can do and cannot do. When we grow up, this idenity stays with us.
- the identiy tells us that we enough, and its okay to stop and give up. Its okay to stay the way u are, what will other people think
- soon this identity traps us inside a prison in our own minds, we are just following the image we project to ourselves

# Change
- it takes courage to change our identity, but it can be done.
- it takes courage to take the first step
- true transformation lies in the inner pursuit of self mastery
- it requires vulnerability and humiliation as we are learning to become who we are
