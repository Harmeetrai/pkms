## How to grow as a person
1. Set personal [[my goals]]: Setting clear, specific, and achievable goals can help you focus your efforts and give you a sense of direction and purpose. As you work towards your goals, you can learn more about yourself, your strengths and weaknesses, and what you are capable of achieving. Have [[atomic habits]] that you follow each day ([[habits]])
2. Seek new challenges and experiences: Engaging in new activities and stepping outside of your [[seek discomfort]] can help you learn and grow. This could include trying something new, taking on a leadership role, or traveling to a new place.
3. Learn from others: Surrounding yourself with people who inspire and challenge you can help you grow. This could include mentors, role models, or peers who have different perspectives and experiences.
4. Practice [[mindfulness]]: Being present in the moment and paying attention to your thoughts and feelings can help you gain self-awareness and insight. This could involve practices such as meditation, journaling, or simply taking time to reflect on your experiences. Practice [[stoicism]] as a philosophy.
5. Engage in [[self-care]]: Taking care of your physical and mental well-being is essential for personal growth. This could include activities such as [[gym]], healthy eating, getting enough [[Sleep MOC]], and finding time to relax and recharge. Have a [[skin-care]] routine for both morning and night and stick to it.
