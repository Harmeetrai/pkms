# Fletcher-Munson Curves

The Fletcher-Munson equal-loudness curves display the relationship between per- ceived loudness (in phons) for a given stimulus sound volume (Sound Pressure Level, in dB), as a function of frequency.

The bottom curve shows what level of pure tone stimulus is required to produce the perception of a 10 dB sound. All the curves are arranged so that the perceived loudness level gives the same loudness as for that loudness level of a pure tone at 1 kHz
