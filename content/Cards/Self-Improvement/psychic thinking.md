Psychic thinking breeds anxiety and depression. It’s not just that something scares or upsets us; it’s that we believe that the thought must not only be real, but predictive of future events. Instead of feeling like we are having a down day, psychic thinking makes us assume we are having a terrible life

- A faulty inference is when you come up with a false conclusion based on valid evidence.
  This means that what you’re seeing, experiencing, or understanding might be real, but the assumptions that you are piecing together from it are either not real or are highly unlikely.
- Correcting faulty inferencing begins with first being aware that you’re doing it. In the majority of cases, once you realize that you’re thinking in a false dichotomy or making a hasty generalization, you stop doing it. You understand what it is, and you let it go.
  Training your brain to stop doing it automatically takes time. Think of your mind like a search engine that autofills your terms. If it’s something you’ve input many times over the years, it’s still going to come up for a while. You have to work on consistently adding new thoughts, options, and stimuli to shift what it comes up with naturally.
