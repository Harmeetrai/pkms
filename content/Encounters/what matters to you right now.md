When we consider somewhat often and hard that at some point none of this will matter and that it will be lost, we shine a proportionally bright light on what does matter right now. There is no telling if or what comes after death, there is no telling when it will come for you, but you can know that you are alive right now. Fully enjoy the present moment as often as you can and in as many ways you can, to fall in love with a person, a thing, a moment, yourself, to make the most of everything despite knowing you will lose it all to nothing.
