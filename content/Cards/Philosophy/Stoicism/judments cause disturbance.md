- The samurai swordsman, [[Miyamoto Musashi]], made a distinction between our "perceiving eye" and our "obersving eye." 
	- The observing eye sees what is
	- The perceiving eye sees what things supposedly mean
- An even is inanimate, It's objective? Simply [[it what is it is]] that's what our observing eye sees
- our perceiving eye sees, this brings disturbance with it and then blaming the event:
	- this will ruin me 
	- how could this have happened
	- Ugh! It's so-and-so's fault
