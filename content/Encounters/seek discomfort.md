# Comfort Zone

- Go the extra mile: It’s so easy to be great nowadays because so many people are focused on efficiency: getting the most for themselves with the least amount of time and effort. Let all of them leave the gym early, skip school, take sick days. Commit to becoming the motherfucker with a never-ending task list.
- A lot of us grow out of life’s shallow end but stay there because we [[fear of living|fear the unknown]]. I’m thinking of those who remain in a secure job they hate instead of cutting ties and starting up their own business or applying for a new position elsewhere.
