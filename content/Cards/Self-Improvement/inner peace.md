# Inner Peace
---
Inner peace is the state of being connected to the deep internal knowing that everything is okay and always will be. The concept of finding one’s “inner peace” has been part of spiritual and metaphysical practices for centuries and has just recently become more mainstream with the development of popular [[psychology]].

The idea is simple in theory and complex in practice: By both exploring our understanding of the mind and training it to behave in a certain way, we sort of purify ourselves to experience the essential nature of what we are, which is, as they believe, joy.

Think about it this way: What do you typically imagine will bring you [[happiness]]? Money, a relationship, a promotion? What happens when you achieve those things? Consistently, throughout all of humankind, the answer is the same: You return to your baseline. This is because this kind of happiness is not real. It is only being completely at peace with whenever you are in any given day that you will find a genuine sense of wonder, presence, and joy.

Finding inner peace isn’t always so much about just sitting in the lotus position until wisdom becomes you; it’s about making the uncomfortable decision to stay with your discomfort and to choose differently

[[finding purpose|A good life]] is built from the inside out and is based on a foundation of self-conduct and prioritization. It’s not as dreamy as a vision board, but it’s a lot more effective, become the [[best version of yourself]]
