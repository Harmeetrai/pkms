# Self-care
---
Self-care refers to the activities and practices that you engage in to take care of your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Here are a few ways you can practice self-care:

- Take care of your physical health ([[gym]]): This can include getting enough [[Sleep MOC|sleep]], eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.
- Have a [[morning routine]] and [[bedtime routine]]
- Engage in activities that you enjoy ([[Interests]]): Do things that bring you joy and relaxation, such as hobbies, sports, or spending time with loved ones.
- Pratice [[gratitude]] and [[journal]] often: Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.
- Practice relaxation techniques: Try activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing to help you relax and reduce stress.

Self-care allows a person to have more [[self-confidence]] and have [[happiness]] and [[kindness]] towards yourself. Remember, self-care looks different for everyone. What works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to find activities that nourish and replenish you, and to make time for self-care on a regular basis.
