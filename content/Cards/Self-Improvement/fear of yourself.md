# Fear of Yourself

The fear of failing is often something that holds people back from putting in the work they would need to become truly great at something, but it can also take another, more insidious form. Once we have established something new in our lives, this fear can come up as a constant irrational worry that we’re “missing something,” that our partner is being unfaithful, or that we’re one misstep away from losing it all.

Over time, you convince yourself that [[stop worrying|worrying]] equals being safe. You think that by running worst-case scenarios through your head again and again, you will be better prepared for them. This is completely false. Not only are you draining your energy imagining situations that are very often completely manufactured, but when you are already hypersensitive to any one of these fears or ideas, you will actually create those circumstances simply out of your avoidance or over-responsiveness to them

What keeps the fire of fear raging is the idea that if we accept what we are afraid of, we are giving in to the worst potential outcome. The truth is that when we stop being afraid of what we cannot control and know instead that *nothing* can possibly ruin our lives more than *we* are ruining them with our negative, distracted, and irrational thinking and focus, we are completely freed.

Instead of wasting all of your energy trying to control some worst-case scenario, consider what the message of the fear may be and what it is telling you that you need in your life.

If the fear was an abstract metaphor, what would the meaning be? Is the abrupt loss of income a symbol of your desire for security? Is the fear of the future a symbol for not living fully right now? Is the anxiety about making decisions a symbol for knowing what you really want and being too afraid to choose it?

What’s happening in your brain when you’re very anxious is that you’re taking an often innocuous stimulus and extracting some kind of meaning or prediction from it. When you’re scared, your brain is working in overdrive to identify the thing that can potentially hurt you and then creatively come up with ways to completely avoid that experience. The smarter you are, the better you become at this.
  
However, the more you avoid a fear, the more intense it becomes.

It seems like everyone is [[fear of others|thinking about you, judging you, evaluating you, and determining your status in life]]. They aren’t. Everyone is lost in their own worlds, too focused on themselves, no one cares.
