# Being Yourself

Be yourself not to be more likeable, but so that people will find you and like you for [[best version of yourself|who you really are]], rather than [[fear of living|pretending to be someone your not]]. If you don't show who you really are, then you are feel disconnected from the world and hollow inside. We often [[how do we live our lives|built up a persona based on societal rules when we where young]] and that persona stays with us in social interactions. Don't listen to [[the inner judge]]. What does success mean if the person is a persona of someone who is successful, that [[inner peace|success is not internal but external]]. How can one be [[happiness|happy]] without feeling satisfied with who they are and what they achieved in life. Having people fall in love with the person who isn't you wouldn't be fulfilling.
