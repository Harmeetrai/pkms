# Critical Bands

The human hearing range naturally divides into critical bands, with the property that the human auditory system cannot resolve sounds better than within about one critical band when other sounds are present

The ear operates something like a set of band-pass filters, where each allows a limited range of frequencies through and blocks all others. A constant-volume sound will seem louder if it spans the boundary between two critical bands than it would were it contained entirely within one critical band. In effect, the ear is not very discriminating within a critical band, because of masking.
